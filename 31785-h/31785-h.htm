<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<div class='cap'>IT is probable that many of these pages may be read
with the comforting conviction that the scenes they
depict and the lives they lightly sketch, in no way come
within the range of possibility; but to any reader so little
acquainted with the snares and perils, the misery and
degradation that lay outside the pale of Total Abstinence,
the assurance is tendered that the darkest pictures contained
in this collection of stories are minutely faithful to
life, and that the saddest incidents related have occurred
under the personal observation, or within the knowledge
of the writer.</div>

</div><div class='unindent'><br />&nbsp; SAY, John."</div>

<p>"Well, Ruthie."</p>

<p>"Master's just rung, and he says he
wants you and me to come upstairs
together."</p>

<p>"What for, I wonder! Don't look so troubled,
little woman;" and John, the well-built, broad-shouldered
gardener, looked up with an unmistakable
glance of affection at the somewhat clouded face
of Ruth, the trim, neat parlour-maid, who had come
into the conservatory to bring him the message from
the dining-room. "I'll just wash my hands and be
ready in a minute," he continued, following her into
the kitchen. With much inward trepidation, Ruth,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
accompanied by John, entered the dining-room a few
minutes later.</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. Groombridge, their eldest son, who
was a medical student; three daughters, and one or
two younger boys were seated at the nearly finished
dessert.</p>

<p>"Well, John, I dare say you wonder why we sent
for you and Ruth; but the fact is, your mistress heard
from cook this morning a piece of news which you
have been sly enough to keep from us," said Mr.
Groombridge. Ruth blushed violently, and withdrew
a little behind John's burly figure.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be ashamed of, Ruth; indeed,
you've every reason to be proud and happy," added
Mr. Groombridge, with a kind look and kinder tone.
There was no mistaking the assent that was visible in
Ruth's shy uplifted eyes. She was proud and happy,
and she involuntarily moved a step nearer to John.</p>

<p>"We thought you would like to know, John,"
continued his master, "how really glad we are that
you and Ruth have settled this little affair between
you. You have both been good, faithful servants, and
deserve to be 'happy ever after,' as the story-books
say. Now we want to drink to your health and
future happiness, and you must drink with us."</p>

<p>Mr. Groombridge poured out two glasses of wine,
and handed them to John and Ruth.</p>

<p>"Your health and happiness, John and Ruth," he
said, draining his own glass.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your health and happiness, John and Ruth,"
repeated his wife and children, with their glasses to
their lips.</p>

<p>"And when I go in for matrimony, John, may my
choice be as wise as yours," added the eldest son,
whose partiality for Ruth was no secret.</p>

<p>"No doubt you would like to choose some one who
would be as ready as Ruth to fly at your beck and
call, and think nothing too great a trouble to do for
you, Master Harry," saucily remarked his younger
sister Kate, in an aside.</p>

<p>"Hush, my dear; little girls of sixteen know
nothing about such serious things," gravely responded
Harry. Kate tossed her head, and was about to
reply, when John spoke:</p>

<p>"I'm sure, sir," he began, "that Ruth and me owe
our best thanks to you and mistress for your kindness
in wishing us well, and if I may be bold enough to
say so, sir, we find it our pleasure as well as our duty,
to try and please so good and kind a master and
mistress, and here's to your health and happiness for
many a long day, and the young ladies', and Mr.
Harry's too." And having performed a duty for
himself and Ruth, John tossed off his wine in much
the same fashion as his master.</p>

<p>"Come, Ruth, drink your wine," said Mrs. Groombridge,
perceiving that the girl's glass remained
untouched.</p>

<p>"Drink it, Ruth," said John in an undertone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, don't be bashful, Ruth, we are all your
friends," said Harry encouragingly. But Ruth
advanced to the table, and with trembling hands put
her full glass down. The rich colour that had dyed
her cheeks a few minutes before had gone, and she
was white to the lips, but her voice was firm as she
answered:</p>

<p>"Please, ma'am, I can't drink it."</p>

<p>"Not drink it! Why not, Ruth?"</p>

<p>"Because, ma'am, as soon as I was engaged to
John, I signed the pledge, and determined I would
never touch any intoxicating drink again."</p>

<p>Mr. Groombridge raised his eyebrows, and Harry
gave a low whistle of astonishment.</p>

<p>"What a queer fancy! Perhaps you won't have
any objection to giving your reason for taking such a
step," said Mrs. Groombridge, with a slight hauteur of
manner.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;because,"&mdash;said Ruth hesitating, and
then desperately proceeding; "because, ma'am, I
want to do the best for John that I can, and I mean
him to have a happy home, and never any reason
to be ashamed of me." Ruth stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>"Well, well, that is very good and creditable, of
course, but what has it all to do with not touching
intoxicants?" impatiently asked Mr. Groombridge.</p>

<p>"Oh, sir, it has everything to do with it. If you
knew what I do about the misery and want that has
come to happy hearts and homes, just because the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
wife had got into the habit of taking too much drink,
you would think so too. You know, sir, I was
brought up in the town, and couldn't help seeing the
curse that drink is. Sometimes the husband was the
drinker, and sometimes both of them; and there was
scarce a home about us that hadn't been ruined by
drink; and so I made up my mind that if ever I had
a home of my own, I would do my part towards
keeping it free from such a curse, and for John's sake,
I have signed the pledge, and for John's sake I must
keep it, sir. I hope you and mistress will forgive me
for refusing your wine."</p>

<p>"Bravo, Ruth! you're a brick," cried Harry.</p>

<p>"Be quiet, my son," said his father, adding: "Well,
Ruth, I honour your motive, but there are one or
two points that I can't see at all. Surely, if
you are moderate in your use of stimulant, it
would be a blessing, and not a curse, for it is only
the excessive use of intoxicants which render them
so harmful."</p>

<p>"I can't argue about it, sir. I only know that
every man and woman who is going down to a
drunkard's grave was once moderate in the use of
stimulants, and never had a thought of taking too
much. I know that there are many who are never
anything but moderate drinkers; but there's danger
somewhere, and because I can't rightly say where it
comes in, and perhaps shouldn't know when it did,
I've put myself out of the way of it altogether."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's woman's logic all the world over; but I
would like to know why you cannot just for once take
a glass of wine. You know it's good, and quite
unlike the wretched stuff that ruins so many."</p>

<p>"I've promised not to take any kind of intoxicating
drink, and I dare not break my promise, sir," said
Ruth firmly.</p>

<p>Mr. Groombridge shrugged his shoulders and rose
from the table.</p>

<p>"Wait a minute, John," he said, "we haven't heard
what you think of this fancy of Ruth's."</p>

<p>"To tell the truth, I don't approve of it, sir. It's
as good as saying that she hasn't any faith in herself,
and expected to go to the bad, if she wasn't bound
by a promise she'd put her name to," answered John
in a tone of dissatisfaction.</p>

<p>"My views, exactly, John; besides, it's setting her
judgment against yours, which I wouldn't think of
allowing, even at this early juncture," said Mr. Groombridge,
with a serio-comic expression.</p>

<p>"Oh, father, <i>you</i> wouldn't think of allowing, indeed,
when only a few minutes ago, you declared that
mother's judgment was ever so much better than
yours, and that ever since you had known her, you
had trusted to it more than to your own," cried Kate.</p>

<p>"My dear, your remark is quite irrelevant," and
Mr. Groombridge dismissed the inconvenient topic
with John and Ruth.</p>

<p>"Don't be angry with me, John; I couldn't do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
anything else," timidly said Ruth, as she followed
John back to the conservatory.</p>

<p>"I'm not pleased with you, Ruth, I must say. I
should like the woman I have chosen to have so much
self respect that she would feel it impossible to stoop
to degrade herself, as you seem to think you could
easily do."</p>

<p>"Oh, John, I thought you would understand me
better than that, for you know so much more than
I could tell master and mistress. Why, John, don't
you know how the curse of drink blighted my own
home, and made my early years a misery? Can
I ever forget the nightly horror when my mother
staggered home to rouse the neighbourhood with her
drunken shouts and blasphemies? Can I forget the
dear little ones I nursed while they pined away to
sink into untimely graves? Can I forget my father's
life-long bitterness and premature end? And if I
could forget these things, how could I forget the
dying despair, the loathing of her sin, and yet the
unconquerable craving of disease that held my poor
mother captive through her last hours!"</p>

<p>"Dear Ruthie, hush; don't recall those memories.
A brighter life is before you, and all I blame you for
is because you imagine that without binding yourself
you might follow in your mother's footsteps."</p>

<p>"That is where you are wrong, John," said Ruth, looking
up at him with sorrowful eyes: "At my age my
mother was no more a slave to drink than I am. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
only took it in moderation, and if any one had suggested
to her that she was in danger of becoming an habitual
drinker, she would have been indignant. It was only
because she found that a little stimulant revived her,
when she was weak and ailing, that she began to take
it frequently, till by and bye the habit became so
strong, that though she tried hard to break it she
could not, and why should I be stronger than my own
mother?"</p>

<p>"Well, darling, have it your own way. I shall not
alter my opinion of you; but I won't argue the point.
Now, dry your eyes, and be happy;" and being an
obedient woman, Ruth dismissed her tears, and
smiled up at John.</p>

<p>"Ruth," said John presently; "how is it that you
are afraid for yourself, and yet not afraid for me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, John, I couldn't be; I trust you entirely, and
though you know how much I would like you to
become an abstainer too, not a thought of danger
crosses my mind when you refuse."</p>

<p>"I should be sorry and hurt if you felt otherwise,
my dear, and you may continue to trust me. I could
never disgrace myself and bring more sorrow to you,"
and John took Ruth's hand, and held his head up
proudly, and looked every inch of him a man worthy
of a woman's trust and devotion.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br />UTH, I'm going to spend the evening at
home; my brother Dick's just returned
from Australia, and mother's sent up for
me to see him. You'll come with me, of
course," said John, a few evenings after.</div>

<p>"Oh, I'm so sorry, I can't even ask to be spared.
It's Jane's evening out, and we've got company, and
there's hot supper ordered."</p>

<p>"What a nuisance! Ask Jane to give up for once;
you're always obliging her."</p>

<p>"No, I can't do that, John, for cook is not best
pleased, and Jane doesn't go the way to manage her."</p>

<p>"I'll go and give cook the length of my tongue, I
declare," said John, angrily.</p>

<p>"Now you'll do nothing of the sort. You'll go
and spend the evening with your brother, and give
him my kind regards, and be sure and bring me back
all the news." So saying, Ruth gave John a bright
decided nod, and whisked back into the kitchen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do you think of that, cook? the unreasonableness
of men!"</p>

<p>"What's up now?" asked cook, who was bending
with a gloomy face over preparations for an elaborate
supper.</p>

<p>"Why, John wanted me to go home with him
to-night, and didn't see why I couldn't, though I told
him how busy we should be."</p>

<p>"It's quite enough to have one of you gadding
out and filling my hands with your work," growled
cook.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's too bad, but we'll manage well enough
without Jane; let me help you mix that, now," and
Ruth took the basin, and with deft fingers, which
cook secretly admired, beat the compound it contained
till it was pronounced "just the thing."</p>

<p>Notwithstanding her brightness and ready surrender
of an evening's pleasure, Ruth watched John go
off with a keen feeling of disappointment, and for
some minutes there was silence in the room.</p>

<p>"She's worth a dozen Janes," said cook to herself,
for she was not so wholly engrossed with her
own pursuits as to be quite unobservant of Ruth's
disappointment.</p>

<p>"I don't know how it is," thought Ruth, as the
busy evening wore away; "cook and I do get on well
together; she's quite pleasant to-night, and wasn't
cross, though I took the wrong sauce in just now."</p>

<p>Ah, Ruth, if there were more sunny tempers and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
unclouded faces like yours in the world, there would
oftener come to clouded minds and gloomy moods
just such brightness as you have brought to your
fellow-servant to-night!</p>

<p>John's brother Dick was several years older than
John. Some ten years previously he had taken to a
seafaring life, but soon tiring of it, he had settled in
Australia. We say settled, but Dick Greenwood was
one of those men who could never be truly said to
settle to anything. He had tried farming, but the
work was too hard; then he had joined a party going
into the bush, their free and easy life having an
attraction for him. After that, he went into a city
store, and just as he had mastered the details of the
business and might have succeeded in it, he was
charmed by the performances of a band of travelling
actors, and not being without natural ability in that
direction, he had induced them to accept his services,
and now, with little money, and a great deal of shady
experience, he had worked his passage back to
England, that he might just see how things were
looking in the old country.</p>

<p>"Well, Jack, my boy, how are you?" he said in a
loud, hoarse voice, as John entered the room, which
was redolent of tobacco and brandy.</p>

<p>"All right, Dick; glad to see you, though I
shouldn't have known you again. My word, you're
a little different to the thin lath of a fellow you were
when you left home."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>"You may say so," cried Dick; "I was a poor
milksop then, and no mistake; but I've improved, and,
you bet, I've learned a thing or two."</p>

<p>John was not quite so sure of the improvement.
At least the stripling who had left his father's home
was fresh and pure looking, but the man who had
returned in his place was bloated and pimpled, and
his once frank eyes now wandered furtively about.</p>

<p>"John's grown a fine fellow, hasn't he, Dick?"
asked the mother, proudly.</p>

<p>"He ain't bad-looking, if that's what you mean,
but he don't look up to snuff. No offence, Jack. I'll
teach you a few wrinkles. Have a pipe, boy."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said John, replenishing his own.</p>

<p>"Take a glass," and Dick made a bumper of hot
spirit and pushed it towards his brother.</p>

<p>"I don't take spirit, Dick. A glass of ale now and
then is enough for me."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense, Jack. Take it like a man.
There's nothing like a glass of brandy and water for
putting life into a fellow."</p>

<p>John took the glass, with a twinge of conscience as
he thought of Ruth. But in the excitement of his
brother's stirring accounts of bush life everything else
was forgotten, and he not only drained the spirit
before him, but finished a second glass with which
Dick slyly supplied him.</p>

<p>"I tell you, Jack," said his brother, at the close of the
evening, "life in England is a slow-going, humbugging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
sort of thing; hard work and little pay; you've got
to bow and scrape to those who've got the brass, and
they lord it over you as they don't dare to do
anywhere else. Now, where I've come from, Jack's
as good as his master, and in as fair a way of making
his fortune too. Take my advice, boy, and come
back with me. In a year or two you'll have made a
home for that bonny lass I've been hearing of, and
you can send for her. What do you say, eh?"</p>

<p>For a minute John was too surprised to speak.
"Really, Dick, you've taken me unawares. I'd like
to get on faster than I have been doing, and make a
better home for my little woman than I've any
prospect of doing here; but for all that, what you
propose is too serious a step to think of taking
without a deal of thought, and I don't know what
Ruth would say."</p>

<p>"If the girl's got any grit in her, she'll say, 'go, by
all means, and send for me as quick as you can.'
You can work your passage out, and I could get you
into a store at Melbourne, and you're such a sticker,
you'd be sure to get on. Now I never expect to be a
rich man; I can't plod, and I must have change; but
you're different, and would soon make your fortune."</p>

<p>John bade his parents and brother good-night, and
walked home revolving the new idea. It was
surrounded by a halo of romance that rendered it
increasingly attractive to him. Success and happiness
seemed to lay within his easy reach, and by the time<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
that he arrived at his master's house he had quite
decided to accompany his brother back to Australia,
if Ruth would only consent to follow him.</p>

<p>"And she's such a loving, sensible little thing; she
wouldn't wish to stand in my way for a moment,
especially when she knows it is for her own sake I
want to go."</p>

<p>So thinking, John let himself in through the
garden door, and was not surprised to find a dark
figure, with white cap and apron, standing on the
kitchen doorstep waiting for him.</p>

<p>"You are late, John; cook and Jane have gone
to bed."</p>

<p>"Well, Ruthie, I'm glad of that, because if you're
not too tired, I want a chat with you."</p>

<p>Too tired, indeed! When all the evening Ruth
had been looking forward to that few minutes as her
ample compensation for the disappointments and
worries she had borne so patiently.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<h3>HOPES AND FEARS.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/i032b-h-quote.png" width="80" height="83" alt="&quot;H" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />AVE you had a pleasant evening, John?"
asked Ruth, after sitting for a minute or
two in silence before the dying embers
of the kitchen fire.</div>

<p>"Why, yes, dear, I believe so; but Dick put so
many new ideas into my head that I didn't know
how the time passed," replied John, wondering how
he should speak of his new plans to Ruth.</p>

<p>"What sort of ideas, John?"</p>

<p>"He's been talking of Australia, and saying there's
no place like it for getting on in the world, and,
of course, he's likely to know; and, Ruthie, dear, he
said if I would go back with him, he'd put me in the
way of making money, and getting a home ready
for you in no time."</p>

<p>Ruth took her hand out of John's, and stared
fixedly into the fire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can't you say something, Ruth?" asked John,
after waiting several minutes. Ruth breathed hard.</p>

<p>"What do you say, John? Do you want to go?"</p>

<p>"I don't want to leave you, darling, but if you'd
promise to come out to me, I think it would be a
good thing for both of us. I could get on so much
better, and we could marry so much quicker than
if I plodded on at the rate I'm going now."</p>

<p>"Then," said Ruth, looking up with a brave smile
upon her white face, "you must go, John, and when
you send for me I'll come out to you."</p>

<p>"Bless you, my dear, brave girl, you shall never
repent your decision," cried John. "I'll work harder
than ever, and we'll soon be together again, never to
say good-bye."</p>

<p>But at that dread word, Ruth's composure gave
way, and she hid her face.</p>

<p>"Don't take on so, Ruthie. It will only be a short
separation, and we're bound to each other for life,"
said John, trying to soothe her.</p>

<p>"I've no fear in letting you go from me, John,"
answered Ruth, proudly, through her tears; "and after
you're once gone, I shall look forward to seeing you
again." And the lump in Ruth's throat was choked
back, and she sat up with an air that was plainly
intended to carry a warning to any rebellious tears
that might threaten.</p>

<p>"And now, John, tell me about your brother. Is
he like you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>John laughed.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you wouldn't think so, Ruthie, and I
can't say Australia has much improved him. However,
you must judge for yourself, for I shall take you to
see him soon. He sent kind messages to you, and
is anxious to make your acquaintance."</p>

<p>But Dick was soon dismissed from the conversation,
for Ruth and John had much to talk over that was
of far more interest even than a brother newly arrived
from the other side of the world. Before they parted
that night, John had succeeded in imparting to Ruth
a little of his own enthusiasm in view of the new life
he was about to enter upon, though her last thought
before closing her weary eyes in sleep was: "Women
feel so differently from men, and I must try and not
discourage John by any of my fears, poor boy!"</p>

<p>A few days later she accompanied John to his
home.</p>

<p>"Dick's out, my dear, but he'll be in directly, as
he knew you were coming," said Mrs. Greenwood,
affectionately greeting Ruth.</p>

<p>"He don't care to spend much of his time with
his old father and mother, Dick don't," complained
Mr. Greenwood.</p>

<p>"We can hardly expect he'd settle down to our
quiet ways, father, such a boy for company as he is.
John's different now, and he'll be sure to make a
comfortable stay-at-home husband; but then he hasn't
the go in him that my Dick has."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's quite sufficient, anyhow," said Ruth quickly,
with an instinctive feeling of dislike towards the
brother who she felt must be so different to John.
Truly, as the door opened just then, and Dick's
ungainly figure appeared, the contrast between the
brothers was striking. Ruth's inward comment was
not complimentary, but she struggled with herself,
and when John said by way of introduction, "Dick,
I've brought Ruthie to see you," she stretched out
her hand with no hesitation of manner.</p>

<p>"Glad to see you, my lass. Jack's a more knowing
dog than I thought for, I declare," he exclaimed,
looking at Ruth's sweet, upturned face with such
coarse approbation, that the girl's eyes fell under
his scrutiny.</p>

<p>"Guess I may claim a brother's right a little
beforehand," continued Dick, trying to draw Ruth
to him.</p>

<p>Ruth's eyes flashed, and she started back indignantly,
saying: "Indeed, you shall do no such thing,
Mr. Richard."</p>

<p>"Come, come, Dick, Ruth isn't the girl to allow
any liberty," interposed John, putting Ruth into a
chair.</p>

<p>"Prudish, eh? Ah, well, colonial life will soon
knock that rubbish out of her," returned Dick, in an
unpleasant tone.</p>

<p>"So you're really bent on going as well, John?"
asked his mother, anxiously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, yes, mother; Ruth says she'll come after
me, and I quite agree with Dick in thinking I ought
to be doing better for myself."</p>

<p>"It's hard to bring up children, and then see them
go off to foreign parts so easily," murmured the poor
mother.</p>

<p>"Why, mother, you've got Susan, and Tom, and
Bess all settled near, and I'll come over and pay you
a visit when I've made my fortune; and you may be
sure I'll never forget the dear old folks at home;" and
John laid his hand affectionately upon his mother's
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I say, can't you stop your sentimental rubbish,
and get to business?" cried Dick.</p>

<p>The mother sighed, and knowing well what Dick
would consider a necessary prelude and accompaniment
to business arrangements, brought out a bottle of
spirits, some hot water, and glasses.</p>

<p>"Come, my dear, I'll just mix you a glass, and
we'll make up our quarrel and be friends," said
Dick graciously to Ruth.</p>

<p>"Pray don't trouble, for I never take anything
of the kind," replied Ruth, very stiffly.</p>

<p>"Mean to say that you belong to the teetotal set!"</p>

<p>"I do."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad Jack's got better sense than to
follow your example," answered Dick; and from that
time he treated Ruth with open disdain.</p>

<p>For John's sake she controlled herself, and sat beside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
him listening, with an aching heart, to the account
of colonial life as Dick had known it; watching also,
with a vague uneasiness and dread, John's frequent
applications to the spirit with which his brother
supplied him. If, in her presence, he so readily
yielded to Dick's persuasion to take "just a drop
more," what might be the consequence when he was
far away from her, and completely under his brother's
influence?</p>

<p>In one hour all Ruth's bright hopes for the future,
and John's well-doing in a distant land, faded; and
when she passed out of the reeking atmosphere of
the little room into the cool, tranquil moonlight, her
heart seemed to have died within her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<h3>QUITE UNLIKE HIMSELF.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 80px;">
<img src="images/i032b-h-quote.png" width="80" height="83" alt="&quot;H" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />OW quiet we are, to be sure!" exclaimed
John, when he began to observe that
Ruth was paying no attention to his
noisy talk. "I suppose you're offended
with Dick. That's very silly, for he means no harm,
and has just been used to say what he likes. He's a
good-hearted fellow at bottom."</div>

<p>"I don't mind for myself, John; but, oh, I'm sure
he won't do you any good. I wish you would go out
by yourself, and not depend upon his promises, for
I feel he isn't to be trusted."</p>

<p>"Rubbish, Ruth; who should I trust if not my own
brother? and besides, I've got my eyes open, and am
able to look out for myself."</p>

<p>"But, John, do forgive me for saying it, you didn't
look out for yourself even this evening, for you let
Dick give you more brandy than you have ever been
in the habit of taking, and it has made you quite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
unlike yourself, and I cannot help being afraid of
what may happen if you go away with him."</p>

<p>"I suppose you mean to say I'm drunk," angrily
cried John.</p>

<p>"No, John, I can't say that; but it wouldn't take
much more brandy to make you so."</p>

<p>"Then you'd best go home by yourself, for I'm no
fit company for you," and John roughly threw Ruth's
hand off his arm, and turned back with unsteady footsteps
towards the town. The girl stood dismayed.
John was indeed quite unlike himself, to leave her in
a lonely road to find her way home unattended. She
waited for some time, hoping that he would relent,
but the last sound of his footsteps died away, and
presently she slowly walked on.</p>

<p>"Why, where's John?" asked cook, as Ruth entered
the kitchen.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll be in directly, I expect. He's just
turned back for something. You go off to bed, and
I'll see to the fire," carelessly returned Ruth.</p>

<p>"Something wrong, I believe," said cook to herself,
as she lit her candle, and followed Jane upstairs.</p>

<p>For an hour Ruth waited, and then, unable to bear
the suspense, she threw a shawl over her head, and
slipped down to the garden gate to watch for John. At
length, shivering with cold, she was about to return to
the house, when she heard in the distance the noisy
snatch of a song. "It can't be John, of course; but
I'll just hide behind the laurels till the drunken fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
has passed," thought Ruth. Nearer and nearer came
the sound, till, with beating heart, Ruth stepped into
the moonlight, and laid her hand on the lips that
were profaning the stillness of the midnight air.</p>

<p>"Oh, John; hush, hush! If master should hear
you! Oh, what have you been doing, my poor boy?"
John made but a feeble resistance to the strong loving
hands that drew him into the house.</p>

<p>"Well, I've had a spree, and why mayn't I, with
my own brother?" he said, with an inane smile on his
face, as he sank into a chair. Ruth made no answer,
but wrung a towel out of cold water, and bound it
around John's throbbing temples. Then she put the
remains of some strong coffee, which had been sent
down from the drawing-room, over the fire.</p>

<p>"Drink it," she said, offering it to him when it was
sufficiently heated.</p>

<p>"It's horrid," said John, shuddering as he tasted
the unmilked, sugarless liquid.</p>

<p>"It will do you good; drink it at once." John
obeyed, and Ruth stood watching the effect of
ministrations such as she had so often rendered in the
past to her drinking mother. In a few minutes John
rose to his feet with a sigh.</p>

<p>"I've been a fool to-night, Ruth; but I'll go off to
bed, and by morning I'll be in my right senses," he
said.</p>

<p>She lit his candle, and carried it for him to the
foot of the attic stairs, then went to her own room,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
and till morning light dawned, resolved endless
schemes for preventing the carrying out of John's
plans to go abroad with the brother whose influence
had already been so powerful for evil. Finally, she
determined to speak plainly to John, and tell him she
could never consent to follow him if he had anything
to do with Dick, unless he promised to sign the
pledge before going away. Then she fell into a
troubled sleep, until it was time to commence another
day's duties.</p>

<p>"I'm desperately ashamed of myself," said John,
when alone with Ruth the next day; "can you find
it in your heart to forgive me for costing you so much
pain?"</p>

<p>"Don't talk of forgiveness, John; I shall think
nothing of all I have suffered, if it will only teach
you to be careful and avoid drinking with Dick in the
future."</p>

<p>"I promise you he shall never make me forget
myself again; and if you will only trust me, dear, I'll
try and hold my head up once more."</p>

<p>"I do trust you, John; but I want you to do what
I have done, and promise faithfully not to touch
drink again. If you take only a little, it may lead to
more, as it did last night; but if you can say 'I never
touch it,' you put yourself out of the way of being
tempted. Do listen to me now, and be persuaded."</p>

<p>"Really, Ruth, that is too much to expect. It isn't
manly to be bound by a pledge, and it makes a fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
look as if he hadn't any pluck or self-confidence to be
afraid of a glass. Why, I believe Dick would have
nothing to do with me if I took your advice."</p>

<p>"So much the better, then," was the decided
answer; "Dick will be your ruin if you depend on
him. Do give him up and go out by yourself.
Master would give you testimonials to his friends in
Melbourne, and you could be quite independent of
your brother."</p>

<p>"I'm not going to depend on Dick; I've got myself
to look to. All I want from Dick is a start, and
I'll take care he doesn't lead me into harm's way. If
not for my own sake, for yours, Ruthie, dear, I will
be careful."</p>

<p>It was hard for Ruth to utter her determination
after John's tender words; but the bitter past had
been too vividly before her all the morning to allow
her to falter in her purpose for more than a passing
moment.</p>

<p>"John," she said, "I've quite made up my mind
that I cannot follow you to Australia unless you take
the pledge first, or at least promise that you will not
take intoxicants; for, unless you do so, I know that
with the many temptations you will meet, especially
if you persist in going with Dick, that all hope of a
happy home will be at an end, and I will never risk
passing through what I once did."</p>

<p>"What on earth are you saying, Ruth? Why,
you've promised and can't break your word. I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
going for your sake, and here you say you won't
come out to me," cried John, scarce believing his ears.</p>

<p>"No, John, I can't, unless you promise what I wish.
When I passed my word to you I didn't know what I
know now, and I'm quite justified in recalling my
promise."</p>

<p>"You're a cruel, hard-hearted girl, and I don't
believe you care a straw for me, or you wouldn't
make a hindrance out of such a paltry thing. I only
made a slip yesterday evening, and I vow it shall be
for the last time."</p>

<p>Deeply pained, Ruth only shook her head.</p>

<p>"So you won't believe me! Well, I'll promise no
such thing as you ask. I won't be tied to any
woman's apron strings," and in extreme irritation,
John flung himself out of the kitchen.</p>

<p>"This is too hard!" exclaimed Ruth despairingly.
Poor girl! the only earthly brightness that had ever
come to her was soon quenched in gloom, and she
knew nothing of the comfort and peace which faith in
the protection and love of a Heavenly Father can
afford in the darkest hour. No wonder that courage
and hope nearly died out of her stricken heart.
The days went by, and John made no attempt to
bridge the chasm between himself and Ruth. She
knew he was making preparations for speedily leaving
England. She also knew that whenever he returned
from visiting his father's home, he was more or less
the worse for drink. As usual, she stayed up for him,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
and kept her knowledge of his condition from her
fellow-servants, though she could not hide from them
that the relationship between them had changed.</p>

<p>"You're not treating that girl well, I believe," said
cook sharply to John one day; "you'll never meet her
equal again, though you may cross the seas."</p>

<p>"Mind your own business," angrily retorted John,
following Ruth into the garden.</p>

<p>"Have you anything to say to me, Ruth? I'm
going home to-morrow, and I expect to sail next
week," he said. If his tone had been less hard, Ruth
might have ventured to plead again with him, but she
simply said:</p>

<p>"No, John, I have said all that I mean to, except
that I wish you all success and happiness."</p>

<p>"Same to you, Ruth," dryly responded John, and
turned on his heel.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp;CAN'T think what's come to Ruth,"
said Mr. Groombridge one day, at dinner-time,
about six months after John
Greenwood had sailed for Australia;
"she's lost all her brightness, and goes about the
house as white and silent as a ghost."</div>

<p>"She is greatly changed, poor girl, and though
I cannot get her to confess it, cook tells me there was
some misunderstanding between her and John, and
that she has not heard from him since he sailed,"
replied his wife.</p>

<p>"She told me the other day he had arrived safely
and was doing well in a store," said Harry.</p>

<p>"She would hear all that from his parents; but, my
dear, you had better try and win the girl's confidence,
and see if you can do anything. It's a thousand
pities for a young thing to mope and pine away her
best years, when a little advice may set matters right,
and make two people happy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll do what I can, but I'm afraid it will not be of
much use," said Mrs. Groombridge.</p>

<p>"Ruth," she said, when retiring that evening,
"I want you to do one or two little things in my
room."</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," replied Ruth, and followed her
mistress upstairs. As she was flitting about the
bedroom Mrs. Groombridge suddenly asked:</p>

<p>"By the bye, Ruth, when did you last hear from
John?" Ruth turned away to hide the painful
flushing of her face.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;what did you say, ma'am?"</p>

<p>"When did John last write to you?"</p>

<p>A silence ensued, and then Ruth said: "He's
written to his parents, ma'am, and not to me."</p>

<p>"Why, how is that, Ruth? Surely you expected
to hear from him."</p>

<p>"Not much, ma'am," Ruth forced herself to say.</p>

<p>"But, Ruth, if you are going out to marry him, he
ought to write to you, and you ought to expect him
to do so." Ruth's apparent apathy gave way as the
remembrance of all her happy dreaming swept over
her at her mistress's words. She buried her face in
her hands and wept bitterly. Mrs. Groombridge laid
a kindly hand upon her shoulder. "Sit down, my
poor child, and tell me all about your trouble.
Something is wrong between you and John, and
perhaps I can help to make it right."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, no, ma'am, it's past any one's help," sobbed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
Ruth, and by degrees her sorrowful story was told.
"And, ma'am, I know that his brother will be the
ruin of John; he'll go downhill fast, as many a fine
young fellow has done."</p>

<p>Mrs. Groombridge looked grave. She was no
abstainer, as we know; but she could not help seeing
the danger that menaced John, if he could be so
easily persuaded to overstep the limits of prudence
and sobriety.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ruth, I think there is cause for anxiety
about John, but you must not lose heart. I think
you acted unwisely in letting him go as you did; at
least you might have gone out to him if you knew he
was keeping sober and doing well, and the very
anticipation of your coming might have given him
a motive and impetus that nothing else could. Men
dislike to be forced into anything, and have a great
objection to be bound by a pledge. You should have
been more careful in urging that."</p>

<p>"But, ma'am, John was one of those who needed to
promise, for he's good-tempered and obliging, and
doesn't know how to refuse a friend."</p>

<p>"Still, I think you were too hasty in cutting away
the hope he had of your going out to him. What
has he to look forward to?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right, ma'am. I might have
waited; but I was frightened to think of what might
lie before me. I know the misery of a home cursed
by drink."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ruth, will you write and say as much to John?
Tell him you'll come out to him as soon as he has
a home ready for you, and he can assure you that he
is leading a sober life."</p>

<p>A hard, almost defiant look passed into Ruth's eyes
for a moment. She thought how cruelly John had
left her, without a word of tenderness, and she said
coldly: "Oh, no, ma'am, I couldn't do that; if John
would write and ask me, I might; but I will never
humble myself to him, for he has been wrong and
unkind all through, and I dare say he's glad to be
free." She had said the same to herself many a time
since the morning when John had said good-bye to
her with as much composure as if he were going to
return in a few hours, and she had almost grown to
believe they must be true. Nevertheless, her heart
leaped to hear her mistress say:</p>

<p>"You should not try to think that, Ruth, for
I believe you wrong John by doing so; he is true
and manly, and probably he would be only too happy
to receive a letter from you."</p>

<p>"Well, ma'am, I don't feel as if I could write first,"
was the obstinate reply; and Ruth presently left
the room with a still heavier heart than she had
entered it.</p>

<p>"It's a sad case, George, and my conscience is not
at rest about the part we have played in it," was
Mrs. Groombridge's remark to her husband, after
retailing her conversation with Ruth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"How are we to blame, my dear?" was the
surprised question.</p>

<p>"I can't help remembering how we laughed at Ruth
for her fanatical whims as we called them, and
encouraged John to do the same. Events have
proved she was right. Perhaps if we had taken
another stand, John might have followed Ruth's
example, and all this unhappiness been spared to
both."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," was the curt response.</p>

<p>"Harry, my boy," said his father the following
morning, "how many cases did I hear you say you
had at the hospital the other day which were the
result of drink?"</p>

<p>"About three-fourths, father; of course, not all
caused by the drinking habits of the patients
themselves: but when a child is brought in badly
burned because its mother was off on a drinking spree,
or when a man has been run over because a driver is
the worse for drink, or even when a woman is dying
of disease, the result of want and neglect which drink
has brought about, I suppose it's quite fair to credit
the drink as the indirect cause of such cases."</p>

<p>"Oh, decidedly! Good gracious! I wish the
Government would let all other questions go to the
wall, Ireland included, while they did something to
mend matters!"</p>

<p>"My dear, how would you like Government to step
in and stop your supplies?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'd be content they should do that, if it were for
the public good," warmly replied Mr. Groombridge.</p>

<p>"I have heard of private individuals not waiting
for the interference of Government; but who, believing
it to be for the public good, have themselves
banished all intoxicants from their homes," said
Mrs. Groombridge, in a meaning tone.</p>

<p>Mr. Groombridge looked thoughtfully at his wife
across the table, but said nothing, and the subject
dropped.</p>

<p>That evening Jane the housemaid bounced into the
kitchen, and flung herself into the nearest chair.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" asked cook, glancing at
her disturbed face.</p>

<p>"A very good matter indeed! I'm going to make
a change. I've had enough scolding and faultfinding,
as I told mistress a minute ago."</p>

<p>"I suppose she's given you a month's notice, and
you deserve it richly for your saucy tongue."</p>

<p>"You're a fine one to talk, for I couldn't hold
a candle to you! Yes, she told me I had better look
out for another place, and I told her it was just what
I had thought of doing."</p>

<p>"Well, I hope you'll be taught a lesson, for I tell
you there aren't many mistresses as kind and
considerate as Mrs. Groombridge, and you'll find it
out to your cost, I'm afraid," said Ruth.</p>

<p>"You've got no cause to complain, for every one
of them pets you up to the skies," replied Jane.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ruth's earned all she gets, and so have you, Jane,
for the matter of that. She's obliging and respectful,
and you're disagreeable and pert half your time,"
said cook.</p>

<p>"I ought to be flattered, I'm sure," retorted Jane,
tossing her head as she sat down to continue her work
of trimming a hat with some particularly smart
ribbons and flowers. The month passed and Jane
left, a new housemaid coming in the same day.</p>

<p>"A different sort to Jane, I can see," whispered
cook to Ruth, as the new-comer went upstairs to take
her bonnet off. It was a pretty, modest face that
presently showed itself in the kitchen; but there were
traces of sadness about the eyes and mouth, and the
new housemaid's dress was trimmed with crape.</p>

<p>"Poor thing! perhaps she's lost her mother,"
thought Ruth, and cook's usually sharp voice softened
as she asked the girl her name.</p>

<p>"Alice Martin," was the timid reply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<h3>THE NEW HOUSEMAID.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 81px;">
<img src="images/w-quote.png" width="81" height="83" alt="&quot;W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />OULD you believe it, Ruth, that girl's a
regular Methodist; read her Bible, and
said her prayers like any parson last
night and again this morning. If she
don't work as well as pray, I'll be down on her,
sharp."</div>

<p>Ruth looked up with a wondering glance at Alice,
who entered the kitchen at that moment with brushes
and brooms. A Bible-reading, praying housemaid
was a curiosity she had never witnessed. But Alice
looked bright and business-like enough to allay any
fears respecting her capability to perform her allotted
tasks, and after a pleasant "good morning," she
proceeded to go about her work in a manner that
showed she knew all about it. After a few weeks
had passed, both cook and Ruth agreed that the new
girl was quite a treasure, with the reservation from
cook, who saw no connection between Alice's religion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and her daily life&mdash;"if it wasn't for her precious
chapel-going and religious humbug."</p>

<p>"Come with me for a walk, Alice, instead of going
to your class; it's a shame to stay indoors such an
afternoon," said Ruth, one Sunday.</p>

<p>"Oh, I couldn't miss my class for anything; but do
you come with me, and we can have a little walk
after."</p>

<p>Ruth hesitated. She knew that cook would laugh
at her for going, but she was feeling low and depressed,
and the thought of a solitary walk was irksome to
her.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't mind, just for once. It's miserable
to walk by one's self," she said.</p>

<p>So she went to the Bible-class which Alice so
regularly attended. The lesson was interesting and
impressive, and as, from the lips of the minister's wife
who gave it, there fell words of invitation to the sin-burdened
and weary, Ruth felt strangely moved.
Unconsciously her tears fell, for her heart ached with
loneliness and longing as she heard of the Saviour and
Friend, who was willing to come into her life and
crown it with His forgiving love and mercy. She
walked on in silence by the side of her companion.</p>

<p>"How did you like Mrs. Evans?" Alice presently
asked.</p>

<p>"She made me feel wretched; I don't want to go
again."</p>

<p>"That was just how I felt when I first heard her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
talk; but do go again, for she will do you so much
good."</p>

<p>"You never had such reason as I have to be
wretched and miserable," exclaimed Ruth.</p>

<p>"Oh, you don't know; I've had more trouble than
I've known how to bear; and then there was the
burden of my sins that made me more unhappy than
I can tell you," added Alice, timidly.</p>

<p>"I don't know anything about that; but I do know
that my life is a burden. I had a wretched home,
and when I went to service, and something that
seemed too good to be true came, it was just taken
from me, and now, I'd like to die and be out of my
misery."</p>

<p>"Do tell me what your trouble is, dear, then I will
try to help you," affectionately pleaded Alice.</p>

<p>Ruth needed no persuasion. The sweet consistency
of Alice's life, her invariable good temper and
readiness to help, and a certain wistful look in her
eyes when Ruth was more than usually depressed,
had won her confidence and affection, and the story
of her life was readily poured into the ear of her
sympathising fellow-servant.</p>

<p>"And now," concluded Ruth, "if you think
there's any hope or help for me, I shall be
surprised."</p>

<p>"Ruth, I know what it is to have a home like
you have had, and I know what it is to lose one more
dear than any, and I can not only sympathise, but I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
can assure you there is both hope and help for you,"
replied Alice, with full eyes.</p>

<p>"Poor girl! then you have suffered, too!"</p>

<p>"Yes, my father drank himself to death, and my
mother died of a broken heart soon after, and then I
went to service. I was engaged to a young man I
had known a long while, and we were to have been
married this spring, but he died quite suddenly, and I
thought my heart would break; but Mrs. Evans came
to see me, and helped me so much. She told me
of the One who can heal every wound, and now, if
I feel lonely and sad sometimes, I know I have a
friend in Jesus, and I just go to Him and tell Him
about my heart-ache, and He comforts me."</p>

<p>"Would He give me back my John, if I asked
Him, do you think, Alice?" suddenly asked Ruth.</p>

<p>"Perhaps He would, but He will certainly help you
to bear your sorrow if you go to Him."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid to go to Him, Alice. I'm only a
servant, and I've done a great many wrong things,
and He might be angry."</p>

<p>"No, dear, for He says: 'Come unto Me, all ye
that labour and are heavy laden,' and He means
it. Take your sins to Him first, and ask His forgiveness,
and then tell Him all about your trouble. Shall
we hurry home and pray together?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, for it's all new to me, and I would like
you to show me how to pray."</p>

<p>The two girls hurried home, and knelt together,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
while in simple, heartfelt words, Alice laid the need
of her companion at the feet of Him who hears and
answers prayer.</p>

<p>"That has done me good; thank you so much,
Alice," whispered Ruth, with a grateful kiss.</p>

<p>"You will pray by yourself, won't you, dear?"
asked Alice.</p>

<p>"Yes, and for John too," answered Ruth, a bright
hope already dawning in her heart.</p>

<p>That evening, at Alice's suggestion, she looked
through the Bible for promises to meet her special
need. When she went downstairs to lay supper, it
was with a glad heart at the abundant encouragement
she had received. From that time she commenced a
new life, and though her feet often faltered in the
upward path, and her heart sometimes grew heavy
with foreboding fears, a light had arisen for her which
grew brighter as the months passed. Many times she
sorely regretted that she had let John go from her in
pride and anger. If she had but the opportunity
now&mdash;and her heart ached for it&mdash;how tenderly she
would plead with him to be true to himself and
her.</p>

<p>"John says he supposes you've forgotten all about
him," said Mrs. Greenwood one evening, when she
had called.</p>

<p>Ruth's face grew scarlet.</p>

<p>"Why doesn't he write to me, then, and let me
know what he means?" she cried with bitterness.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm sorry you should have quarrelled, my dear,
for I believe you're the very woman for him; and I
know he's desperately fond of you, and here's Dick
saying Jack would do better with a woman to keep
him out of mischief."</p>

<p>"What's his address?" asked Ruth. It was written
down for her, and she soon made an excuse to leave.
There were many conflicting thoughts and emotions
at work in her mind and heart. How could John
suppose she could ever forget him? Had he said
anything to his mother about his being desperately
fond of her, or was it only Mrs. Greenwood's
surmisings? And what did Dick mean by saying
that John would do better with a woman to keep him
out of mischief? Was he going downhill so rapidly
that his degraded elder brother had lost control over
him? Might John himself be longing for an assurance
that he was forgiven, and if the assurance were
given, would it be a help and stay to him? Oh, if she
dare think so! Well, she would risk it, and write that
very night, and as she made the decision a great
burden fell from her, and she knew her decision was
right.</p>

<p>Far on into the night Ruth sat writing sheet after
sheet by the light of her candle. She wrote of the
new joy that had come to her since John left,
and told him it had only increased her love and
yearning for him; how night and day she prayed
that he might be kept from harm and evil, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
some day they might yet meet and be happy. She
concluded by asking him to forgive her, if she had
seemed hard and unkind, and reminded him again of
her own painful past, and how she felt it was wrong
to face a future that might hold a like experience for
her; but if he could only assure her that he was
living a sober, respectable life, and intended doing so,
she would come out to him just as soon as he had a
home ready. Then with many tears and prayers
Ruth directed her letter and went to bed.</p>

<p>Ah, poor Ruth! could she have foretold the fate of
her letter, how would the bright hopes she was
entertaining have been quenched in darkness!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>THE FATE OF RUTH'S LETTER.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 74px;">
<img src="images/i053b-d.png" width="74" height="82" alt="D" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />ICK GREENWOOD was slowly sauntering
up one of the chief streets of the city of
Melbourne. Turning down a side street,
he entered into a store, and asked if any
letters had been left there for him or his brother.</div>

<p>"Why, yes, I believe there's a packet knocking about.
Jones, reach 'em off that shelf," answered the foreman.</p>

<p>A letter from his mother, and another in a strange
handwriting to John, was passed across to Dick, who
took them and left the store.</p>

<p>"That plaguey boy may fetch his own letters.
Blowed if I'll waste my time calling round; but
who's been writing to him now, I wonder? Some
woman's hand. That means mischief, for sure!"</p>

<p>Dick turned the envelope over, and studied the
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'caligraphy'">calligraphy</ins> with an air of uncertainty. Suddenly he
exclaimed, half aloud:</p>

<p>"It's from that soft fool of a girl, I'll bet anything.
She's found out which way her bread was buttered,
and means to come the doubles over Jack; but not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
quite so easy done, my girl. The boy's got a brother
who'll look after him, so here goes;" and Dick tore
open the envelope, glanced at the signature, nodded
his head in triumph, and deliberately read the closely-written
pages.</p>

<p>"The lying humbug! So that's the way she'd throw
dust into Jack's eyes, and he'd be as innocent as a
new-born babe, and write back begging her forgiveness,
and telling her he'd be ready for her in a trice!
Bah, how I hate such tomfoolery!" and Dick tore
the letter, which had been written with so many tears
and prayers, into a hundred fragments, and sent them
flying down the street.</p>

<p>Some days later found him back in a bush settlement,
where he had, a few months before, persuaded
John to join him. Despite the latter's attempt at
bravado, he had left England with a very sore heart,
and a resolve to show Ruth that he could keep steady,
and make his way in the new land. He quite intended
to save money towards preparing a home; and thought
that, in a year or two, he would write to Ruth, and
ask her to overlook the past, and come out to him,
for he never doubted her love and fidelity. But,
though he had soon found a situation where he might
have risen and achieved his purpose, he had no sooner
commenced to save than his brother Dick would
appear, and lead him into scenes of revelry and dissipation,
where his money would be more than wasted.
After one of these times John said, with bitterness:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pity I didn't bring my Ruth out! She'd have
kept me straight instead of helping me down as
you do."</p>

<p>In a letter that Dick had subsequently written
home, he had sneeringly said that Jack wanted a
woman to look after him. What effect that remark
had upon Ruth we have previously seen.</p>

<p>Finally, Dick had persuaded John to leave his
situation, and join him and his lawless companions
in their wild bush life; yet, even there, his thoughts
often reverted to Ruth, and he made up his mind
that if she would only break the silence and tell him
she cared as much as ever for him, he would leave
his present surroundings and begin a new life. Often,
when engaged in pursuits new and exciting, or
carousing with companions as degraded as his own
brother, the sweet, happy restraints of the old home
life, and the pure face of the woman he loved would
rise before him in vivid contrast, and with an
unutterable loathing he would turn from his present
life, and long to be free. Yet he lacked moral courage
to break from his brother's influence; and, as John,
in many ways, proved serviceable to Dick, the latter,
by flattery or by threats, was continually strengthening
his hold upon John's weaker nature. So Dick was
rejoiced that Ruth's letter had fallen into his hands,
well knowing that John could never have withstood
the temptation it would have presented to him.</p>

<p>"Any letters from home, Dick?" inquired John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
of his brother, who sat before a rough, uncovered
table, making heavy inroads upon the provisions with
which it was loaded.</p>

<p>"There's one in my coat," answered Dick, nodding
in the direction of his top-coat, which he had flung
aside on entering. John got up and felt in the pocket,
and drew out his mother's letter.</p>

<p>"No other, Dick?"</p>

<p>"No; ain't that enough for you?" was the answer.</p>

<p>John took the letter and went out of the room.</p>

<p>"She is too hard on a fellow, she is; but, oh,
Ruthie, if I had you here, I'd be out of this soon
enough!" he said to himself.</p>

<p>Yet, all through the hours of the following night,
John laughed as loudly and drank as deeply as any
of the rough men who had been invited to meet Dick,
and listen to the news after his short absence from
the settlement. In the early dawn, the company
broke up, and left the log building, making, as they
went to their several homes, the still, fragrant air
resonant with snatches of ribald song and coarse jest.</p>

<p>Dick threw himself upon a settle and was soon
sleeping heavily; but John staggered out of the
noisome atmosphere, and leaned against the framework
of the door. The cool morning breeze fanned
his heated brow, and the twitter of the birds fell on
his dulled ears. The stars had paled, but the moon
shone clear in the blue sky, now fast taking on the
gorgeous hues of the dawn. He stood, unconscious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of the beauty of scene and sound around him, till
the echoes of his late companions' unhallowed mirth
had died away. Then there came to him, as there
always did at such times, the thought of Ruth. What
would she say to see him now? Yet, deeply though
he had fallen, John would have given worlds, if he
had possessed them, to have stood in her presence
at that moment with drooping head, and confessed
all his weakness and misery, and begged her to forgive
him, and help him to retrieve the bitter past.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ruth, you took the pledge for my sake, and
now, if you were only here, I'd take it for my own
sake and yours too," groaned John.</p>

<p>It was only the fancy of a heated imagination,
of course, but just then, as the first ray of the rising
sun glanced through the forest clearing, and fell at
his feet, he felt himself looking down into Ruth's
upturned, pleading eyes; her hand lay on his arm,
and her voice said: "For my sake, John, take it now!"
He started, as if from a dream, and looked round.
No apparition melted into morning mist, no human
form was yet stirring, but, with a strange, mingled
sense of awe and gladness, John said:</p>

<p>"Bless you, my Ruthie, I will, for your sake! You
shall never have cause to be ashamed of me again!"</p>

<p>Then he turned indoors, and, throwing himself down
beside his brother, was soon fast asleep.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>A HAPPY ENDING.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 88px;">
<img src="images/i058b-y-quote.png" width="88" height="82" alt="&quot;Y" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />OU skulking good-for-nothing greenhorn!
go and beg on the streets if you will, for
I'll never raise my hand to save you from
starvation," roared Dick Greenwood,
when a few hours later John told him he intended
returning to Melbourne.</div>

<p>"I quite believe that, Dick, for you've done your
best to bring me to it," replied John.</p>

<p>But Dick poured out such a volley of oaths, that
John wisely forbore to say anything further.</p>

<p>Finding he could not provoke John to retaliate,
Dick sneered: "I suppose now you've sown your wild
oats, and got all you could out of me, you'll be
sending for that smooth-tongued, virtuous wench to
come out and help you keep straight, for such a poor
weak fool as you'll never do without some one to look
after you; but see if I don't let her know a few of
your nice little secrets."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>John's blood was raised to boiling-point. He
started to his feet, and the next minute Dick lay
prostrate before him.</p>

<p>"Take that," he cried; "and if you dare to say one
more word about her, I'll give you cause to repent it.
You're not worthy to lick the ground she treads on."</p>

<p>Dick looked up, but neither moved nor spoke,
while his younger brother thrust a few odds and ends
into a bag, and prepared to leave. Coward as he was,
he feared to provoke John's just anger again, and not
till after the door was violently slammed behind his
brother, and the sound of his rapid footsteps had
died away, did Dick rise from the ground.</p>

<p>Then he shook himself to ascertain if he had
received any damages, and finding himself not much
the worse for his fall, he sat down and took out his
pipe. For some time he smoked furiously, and then
struck his hands together as he exclaimed:</p>

<p>"I'll do it, as sure as I live! I'll pay him out for
this, or my name's not Dick Greenwood."</p>

<p>Three days after, John walked into the store in
Melbourne, where he had been previously employed.</p>

<p>"It's you, is it?" said the foreman; "ain't you
satisfied with your change?"</p>

<p>"No," said John, with emphasis; "I'd rather sweep
a crossing. I suppose you've filled my place."</p>

<p>The foreman nodded, and jerked his thumb in the
direction of a young man who was leisurely serving a
customer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you really want work, man, or is it only 'come
and go' again?" asked he, seeing that John looked
disappointed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Smith, I'd give anything for a chance to work.
I'm sick of knocking about."</p>

<p>"Well, look here! he ain't up to much good," and
the shopman was again indicated; "got no 'go' in
him, and you always suited me. You may come and
show him how to do business in my line, but you'll
have to start with lower wages, eh?"</p>

<p>John thankfully accepted the offer. "Now for
Ruth and a home of my own!" he said the next
morning, when beginning his work.</p>

<p>It was scarcely a wise decision he had made, not to
write to her until he was ready to send for her; but a
certain feeling of pride held him back, for he said:
"She doubted me once, and now I'll wait till I can
prove myself worthy of her trust."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in heart-sickening suspense, Ruth waited
mail after mail for an answer to her letter. At last
there came one for her, bearing the Australian postmark.
She tore it open in fear, for the handwriting
was strange. It ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Dear Miss,</p>

<p>"I am sorry to send you bad news, but you
must take it kindly from one who wishes you well. The
truth is, that Jack is going to the bad as fast as he can,
which I'm sorry to say of my own brother. I was downright
ashamed of the way he went on, after reading a letter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
you sent him. He got real mad over it, and swore he'd
have nothing to do with a canting Methodist, and a deal
more which I won't write, not wishing to put you about.
Last of all, he tore the letter up. I write these few lines
to save you from expecting to hear any more of him, as he's
off on his own hook, and I wash my hands of the scamp.</p>

<p>"Hoping you are in health, I remain,</p>

<div class='sig'>
<span style="margin-right: 3em;">"Your obedient servant,</span><br />
"<span class="smcap">R. Greenwood.</span>"<br />
</div></div>

<p>Ruth sat stunned. The bell rang, but she heeded
not. Alice came up, but she took no notice of her
anxious inquiries. Hearing of her condition, Harry
Groombridge left the dinner-table and went to her.</p>

<p>"She's had some shock; this letter doubtless!
May I read it, Ruth?" he asked.</p>

<p>The girl mutely assented.</p>

<p>The young man glanced through the contents, and
handed it to his mother, who had followed him. She
read it, and they exchanged looks. Then Mrs.
Groombridge took one of Ruth's cold hands in hers,
and said:</p>

<p>"Ruth, my dear girl, this letter is a hoax, I am
persuaded, for you know John's brother is an unprincipled
man. I think he has quarrelled with
John, and then revenged himself by writing to you
in this cruel way. I can't think John has gone
so far wrong as to talk of you before his brother in
such a manner. My impression is, that he was glad
to get your letter, and left his brother, resolving to
prove himself worthy of you yet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's about it," remarked Harry.</p>

<p>Ruth gasped with a sense of relief.</p>

<p>"Oh, if I could but think so; but then, why doesn't
he write himself?" she said.</p>

<p>"I can't say, but trust him a little longer, Ruth.
When did his parents last hear from him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, ma'am. Lately I've felt I couldn't
go there."</p>

<p>"You shall run down to-night; or stay, you are
not fit to go. Harry, will you go at once to Mrs.
Greenwood, and ask her to bring John's last letters?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure, mother." He soon returned with
Mrs. Greenwood.</p>

<p>"You've had a letter from Dick, my dear, that's
upset you, so the young gentleman says. I hope he's
all right, for it's long since we had a line, though we
hear every other mail from John," she said.</p>

<p>"Do tell me where he is, and what he is doing, for
Dick says he is going to the bad fast, and I can't
believe it," said Ruth.</p>

<p>"That I'm sure he isn't," cried the mother; "he left
the store to go with Dick, but he's gone back now,
for he says it was a wild life that didn't suit him, and
he got into a bad set; but he's doing well now, and
living quiet and respectable, and tells us he has signed
the pledge, and&mdash;and&mdash;but oh, my dear, I wasn't to
tell you this; for he meant to write himself and tell
you all about it, but you were so anxious, what could
I do?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth's eyes filled with happy tears. How
abundantly her prayers were being answered she
only found when she came to read John's letters!</p>

<p>"I must wait patiently till he writes to me; but
why doesn't he reply to my letter?"</p>

<p>"Depend upon it, Ruth, he never had it, or he
would at least have mentioned it when writing home.
It must have fallen into his brother's hands," replied
Mrs. Groombridge.</p>

<p>"I don't believe Dick is as bad as that," said the
mother, when Ruth's mistress had left the room.</p>

<p>"My dear," said Mr. Groombridge, after hearing
the story; "I shall persuade Ruth to go out at once.
Our friends, the Grahams, who find it so difficult to
secure good servants in Melbourne, will be only too
glad of Ruth's help until John can make her a home,
and she will be a strength and stay to him, and all
suspense for her will be over."</p>

<p>"I don't like to part with Ruth a day before I'm
obliged, but I think your plan excellent," returned
his wife.</p>

<p>It was discovered that, when consulted, Ruth's
opinion coincided exactly with that of her mistress,
and a month afterwards she bade farewell to her
friends and sailed for Australia.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"You've a young man named Greenwood in your
employ, I believe?" said a gentleman, walking into the
store where John was engaged.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I have, sir."</p>

<p>"Can you spare him an hour or two? I want him
to meet a friend who is coming in by the steamer
to-day from England."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. Here, John, this gentleman <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'want's'">wants</ins>
you to go down with him to the Docks."</p>

<p>John looked surprised, but, supposing it to be a
business call, put on his coat and hat and walked
out.</p>

<p>"Are you expecting a friend from England?"
asked the stranger.</p>

<p>"No, sir, I wish I was," was John's involuntary
reply.</p>

<p>"I had a letter from my old friend Mr. Groombridge,
of Bristol, and he asked me to call for you on my
way to the Docks, as some one you once knew was
coming in by the steamer."</p>

<p>"Who did he say it was, sir?" asked John, with a
sudden tumultuous beating of the heart.</p>

<p>"He did mention the name, I believe; but, dear
me, I've left the letter at home. It's no matter,
though, you will soon learn," said Mr. Graham, with
an amused smile, as he watched John's face.</p>

<p>"It couldn't be, of course," argued John to himself;
but as the steamer came in he eagerly scanned the
faces of the passengers, with but one thought.</p>

<p>No, she was not there, and with a bitter feeling of
disappointment he fell back.</p>

<p>"John! Oh, John!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>He looked up. How could he have overlooked
that figure with eager hands stretched out towards
him! Yes, it was his trusting, loving Ruth, who,
unasked, had crossed the seas to help and cheer him
in the hard battle he was fighting for her sake.</p>

<p>"Oh, Ruthie," he said, as he grasped her hands;
"I don't deserve this. Why have you come,
darling?"</p>

<p>"Why, I came for your sake, of course, John; but
are you quite sure you want me?"</p>

<p>"You may well ask that, for I've been a brute to
you; and now I know I ought to have written to
you, but you might have sent me a line, Ruth."</p>

<p>"So I did, and I believe Dick must have got it."</p>

<p>"The scamp!" exclaimed John.</p>

<p>"Ah, don't say anything unkind now, for it's all
happened for the best."</p>

<p>Then Mr. Graham came up, and John went to see
about Ruth's luggage, further explanations and news
from home being reserved till the evening, when John
had finished his day's work.</p>

<p>When Ruth's long story was finished, John sat
thoughtful and silent for some time.</p>

<p>"Yes, Ruthie, I do feel you are right. I want a
stronger power than even my love for you to keep
me from yielding to temptation, and I will from this
time give my whole life, with its many sins and
mistakes, into the Hand of the One who will forgive
all, and make me a new creature," he presently said.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank God for that; we can help each other
now, John!"</p>

<p>It was only a humble home to which John took
Ruth a few months later; but mutual love and trust
made it the happiest place on earth to the two who
had waited so long for the fulfilment of their hopes.</p>

<p>"Guess what news I've got, John," said Ruth, with
a beaming face one morning, shortly after she had
been installed as mistress.</p>

<p>"You've drawn your money out of the Savings
Bank, and taken passage in the steamer that leaves
for England to-day."</p>

<p>"Foolish boy! No, I've had a letter from Alice,
and she says that master and mistress have agreed to
give up all intoxicants, and they say it's all through
our example. How delighted I am, to be sure, aren't
you, John?"</p>

<p>"Yes, little woman, I'm very pleased; but don't say
our example, for you set the example, and you ought
to have all the credit."</p>

<p>"Ah, John, you know I did it all for your sake,
dear," whispered the happy wife.</p>

<h3>MODERATE DRINKING.</h3>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 81px;">
<img src="images/i-quote.png" width="81" height="83" alt="&quot;I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br /> &nbsp;SAY, mother, what do you think's the
latest joke?" said a respectable artisan
to his wife, as he entered his home with
his bag of tools slung across his shoulder.</div>

<p>"I'm sure I can't guess, George," answered the
woman, with a pleasant smile on her face as she
welcomed her husband.</p>

<p>"Well, don't drop the baby when I tell you. Tim
Morris has signed the pledge!"</p>

<p>"Good gracious, George, you don't say so! Why,
do you know, his poor wife came in yesterday
morning to borrow sixpence, for they hadn't a loaf of
bread or a bit of coal in the house; and Tim was out
then, drinking like a beast. Really I can't help
saying such things, George."</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>
<p>"Well this is what I'm told, Susan. He was picked
out of the gutter yesterday evening by some teetotal
folks, and taken to one of their meetings; and, drunk
as he was, he signed, and then they saw him home,
and early this morning they were round to see how
he was; and anyhow he declares he is going to stick
to it. They've taken him on at the works, and given
him another chance of redeeming his character."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to hear it, George; and if the
teetotal folks keep Tim Morris out of the gutter, I'll
never say another word against them, and shan't let
you either."</p>

<p>"I don't think I shall want to if they do; but I've
very little hope, Susan. It'll be the first time that
ever I heard of a man who had sunk so low being
reclaimed."</p>

<p>"Yes; all I've ever given that kind of people credit
for doing, is to get as many little ones into their
meetings&mdash;Bands of Hope, don't they call them?&mdash;and
make them sign the pledge, and as soon as ever they
get to a sensible age, they find out how foolish they've
been, and break all their fine promises. And no
wonder, for I don't know how people could get on
without their glass of ale or porter two or three times
a day. I couldn't for one."</p>

<p>"And I'm sure I should be lost without my pint at
dinner and supper," echoed George, adding: "I guess
we're the moderate drinkers teetotalers rave about."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense," answered Susan. "Why<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
can't they abuse the creatures who never know when
they've had enough for their own good, without
wanting to take one of our necessary comforts from
us, when we pay our way, and are decent, respectable
people?"</p>

<p>"That's just what I say, wife. Such folks have
neither sense nor reason on their side. But I can
forgive them all their mistakes if they only turn
Tim Morris into a sober man."</p>

<p>"Well, sit down, George, and hold the baby, while
I put the tea into the pot. Go to father, mother's
little pet;" and Susan Dixon placed the well-cared-for
baby on her father's knee, where, amidst delighted
screams and plunges, she speedily found congenial
employment in burying her fat dimpled hands in his
masses of brown hair.</p>

<p>"There, there, Mattie, won't that do for you, little
lass?" said he, as he gave her back to her mother,
crying with disappointment at the sudden termination
of her delightful frolic.</p>

<p>"She does get on well, mother," he added, looking
with fatherly pride on her rounded limbs and rosy
cheeks.</p>

<p>"There's no earthly reason why she shouldn't, with
all the care that's taken of her. Oh dear! it makes
my heart ache when poor Mrs. Morris steps in here
sometimes, with her sickly-looking child fretting in
her arms, and our Mattie looking so different; I'd
rather bury her, George, than see her like that."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"I tell you, Susan, I think that a man who ruins
the health and prospects of his wife and children
ought to be treated as a felon, and sent to prison until
he'd learnt to behave himself as he ought;" said
George.</p>

<p>The conversation turned shortly after upon other
matters, and presently, baby being put to bed, the
husband and wife settled down to their usual pleasant
evening; for never since his marriage, two years
before, had George left his wife, after returning from
his daily labour, for a longer space of time than was
necessary to fetch the ale for supper from one of the
neighbouring public-houses. They were perfectly
happy in each other, and in the treasure which had
been theirs for nine months, and wondered why
every one could not rest contented as they did, in the
pure delight of home joys.</p>

<p>Day after day, week after week, and even month
after month passed away, and still, to George and
Susan Dixon's unbounded astonishment, Timothy
Morris kept his pledge, and into his wretched home
there began to creep an air of comfort. Rags gave
place to decent clothing, and the children no longer
fled terrified at their father's approach.</p>

<p>"I've got another piece of news for you, Susan,"
said George one evening: "Timothy Morris is
announced to speak at the Temperance Hall to-night."</p>

<p>"Well, I never did! What next?" exclaimed his
astonished wife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, I think the next is that, for the pure fun of
the thing, I'll go and hear him, if you don't mind
being left alone, my dear."</p>

<p>"Oh, no, not for once, George. Besides, I should like
to know what Tim will have to say for himself; and
you'll bring me word, won't you, dear?" replied Susan.</p>

<p>"Of course I'll do that; but I must be quick, for
two of my mates are going to call and see if I'm
coming. I can tell you it's made quite a sensation
among the men to-day."</p>

<p>"I dare say it has," said Susan, bustling about, and
hurrying her husband's tea.</p>

<p>That evening she waited, with the supper-cloth laid,
for an hour past the usual time; and then, wondering
what had kept her husband, took her post at the
street door. Soon she caught sight of three men
coming down the road, and at first thought she
recognised George's figure in the moonlight; but
hearing from the trio noisy snatches of song and loud
laughing, she smiled at the absurdity of her mistake.
But yet, as they came nearer, the tones sounded
strangely familiar. Her heart sank as they halted
before her, and her husband separated from them, and
entered the house, pushing past his wife, and shouting:
"Well, good night, mates; we've not signed the
pledge, as our friend Tim advised, and don't intend to
at present."</p>

<p>"George, where have you been all this time?" said
Susan, as she followed him in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>"In the right place for a Briton who never means
to be a slave&mdash;to be a slave," he answered thickly.</p>

<p>"If this is what temperance meetings do for you,
George, I think you'd better stay at home," said his
wife in displeased tones.</p>

<p>"Don't be high and mighty, my dear; we weren't
going to hear Tim Morris declare that the public-house
wasn't a fit place for a respectable man to put
his nose inside, without showing him that he'd made
a confounded teetotaler's mistake; and being three
respectable men, we went in, and took our supper
beer there, instead of in our own homes. That's all
right, isn't it?" he asked defiantly.</p>

<p>"If you had stopped at your own supper beer it
might have been; but it looks more than likely that
you drank your own and your wife's share too, judging
from appearances," answered Susan bitterly, for she
had been feeling the want of her usual stimulant for
some time past.</p>

<p>"You can fetch yours, my dear; I've no objection,
I'm sure."</p>

<p>"No objection!" Susan felt outraged. If he had
been sober, such a word could not have fallen from
his lips, for he never would permit her to enter the
door of a public-house. There was no help for it
now; she must go, for she could not do without her
customary glass, and she dared not ask George to go,
lest he should be tempted to imbibe still more freely
than he had done.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>Putting on her bonnet, and seizing a jug, she hurried
down the road to the corner where there were four
public-houses blazing with light. She chose the
quietest; and entering the jug and bottle department,
found herself alone, and screened from all eyes, save
those of the barmaid, who stepped forward to take
her jug.</p>

<p>"Half a pint, please," said Susan.</p>

<p>Suddenly a thought struck her. If she took her
ale home George would be sure to want some; and
she knew that he had already exceeded by far his
usual limit; why should she not stand and drink hers
there? There was no one to see her; no one would
ever be the wiser. It would only be just for once, she
told herself, to put temptation out of her husband's
way.</p>

<p>"If you'll kindly bring me a glass, I'll drink it
here," she said to the barmaid.</p>

<p>"Certainly, ma'am;" and Susan rapidly drained
her glass, and walked home with her empty jug.</p>

<p>If that night the heavy curtain which shrouded the
unknown future could have been lifted, and to George
and Susan Dixon there could have been revealed
their unwritten history, with what shuddering awe
would each have turned from the sin-darkened record,
and cried with one of old: "Is thy servant a dog,
that he should do this thing?"</p>

a girl of about seven or eight years of
age, with pallid face, and dress hanging
in tatters about her bare feet, as she
slowly dragged up the broken stairs to the one room
where her father and mother, herself, and four
younger children lived and slept.</div>

<p>"You needn't ask me, child. She's locked her
door, and the little uns are inside; and here's the key.
I 'spect she's off on a spree." The child took the key,
and sighing heavily, proceeded on her way. Two of
the children were screaming loudly, but ceased their
cries as she entered the room, and began, one to
crawl, and the other to toddle, towards the only being
in their little world who never struck or kicked them,
but tended them with the love and gentleness which,
but for her, they would never have known.</p>

<p>"Mammie's left us all alone, Mattie; and Fan and
baby has been crying all the morning, and Bob and
me's been doing all we can, and they won't do nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
but scream," exclaimed the eldest of the four children
in wearied tones.</p>

<p>"That's right, Melie; you're good children; but
I've come home, and 'll look after the lot of you.
What's for dinner? Did mammie say?"</p>

<p>"There's some crusts left up on the mantel,"
answered Melie.</p>

<p>"Bob, you just climb up and fetch 'em down, and
I'll nurse the baby, and, Fan, you come right away
and sit by me." Mattie picked up the dirty, tear-stained
baby, and seated herself on the only chair in
the room. She had been to school all the morning,
and, while ostensibly puzzling her little brain with
the mysteries of "the three R's," her heart had been
full of fear for those little ones in the house. What
if her mother should leave them with the door
unlocked, and Fan and baby should find their way
headlong down those dark, steep stairs? Or, suppose
the window in their room should by any means
become unfastened, and one of them should fall to
the pavement beneath; for Mattie remembered that,
only the week before, a drunken mother had let her
baby drop from her arms out of the window at the
top of the house into the court below, from whence it
had been picked up a shapeless, bleeding mass. So
she was greatly relieved that everything had gone
well in her absence. As for Fan's and baby's crying,
that was to be expected while she was away.</p>

<p>"I shan't go to school this afternoon; 'taint to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
expected as I can, although teacher'll be just mad,
being as it's near 'xamination time," declared Mattie.</p>

<p>"That's prime, Mattie! What'll we do? Not stay
up here all the time?" cried Bob.</p>

<p>"In course not. We'll have our dinner, and then
we'll just get a breath of air in the park. It'll do
baby good; won't it, darling?" said Mattie, stooping
over her puny charge as fondly as if he were the
bonniest baby in the land, instead of a feeble, wan-faced
infant, upon whom, as indeed upon each of the
group which surrounded him, there was stamped the
unmistakable imprint of an inherited curse.</p>

<p>"I'm glad mammie's out, Mattie. I wish you was
our mammie, and could take us clean away," said Bob,
hanging about Mattie's chair.</p>

<p>"When I get bigger and can earn money, that's
what I'm going to do, you know, Bob. Me, and
Melie, and you'll just work and keep the children,
and we won't have 'em knocked about, poor little
mites, will we?"</p>

<p>"No, we won't, but I wish we was big enough
now," sighed Bob, to whom the tempting prospect
was sufficiently familiar and delightful to help him to
bear bravely the privation of his daily lot.</p>

<p>"Well, we ain't, so it's no use wishing we was,"
responded matter-of-fact Mattie; "but I'll tell you
what I do wish, and that is as mammie and daddie'd
just turn over a new leaf, and stop the drinking.
Then we'd never need to be talking of running away<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
and leaving 'em; for I tell you, we'd all pretty soon
know the difference."</p>

<p>"Tell us what a nice home we'd have afore long,
and what jolly things we'd get to eat," said Bob.</p>

<p>"Don't you be so greedy, Bob. 'Tain't the want
of good things to eat as troubles me so much. It's
the rows, and the swearing, and the kicking, and
beating, as takes the life out of one," and Mattie's
face grew dark as she spoke.</p>

<p>"Mattie," asked Melie, as she munched away at
her crust; "do all mammies get drunk like ourn?"</p>

<p>"They do about here, I b'lieve," answered Mattie,
somewhat dubiously; "but lor, no, child, in course
they don't. There's the lady in the shop where
we buy our penn'orths of bread, as allers is as
kind and pleasant spoken to her little uns as&mdash;as&mdash;"</p>

<p>A comparison was not speedily forthcoming, but Bob
finished his sister's sentence by saying: "Like you
are to all of us, Mattie."</p>

<p>"I'd hate to speak cross to bits of things like you,"
answered Mattie loftily, but with a little glow at her
heart because of the spontaneous tribute to her
sisterly care. "We'd better be off, I'm thinking,"
she said presently, and tying an old rag under the
baby's chin by way of head-gear, she passed her own
battered straw hat to Melie, saying:</p>

<p>"You can wear it this afternoon; I'll be quite hot
enough carrying baby, without putting anything on,
I guess."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>As for Bob and little Fan, the lack of outdoor
apparel troubled them not at all; indeed, the
trouble would have been if any such unusual and
uncomfortable addition to their scanty wardrobe had
been forthcoming.</p>

<p>Rejoicing in their liberty, and strong in the
protection of the elder sister, they slowly threaded
their way through crowded thoroughfares, until they
came to the outskirts of the great manufacturing
town, where the park of which Mattie had spoken
was situated.</p>

<p>"That's right! we've got here at last! But you're
real heavy, baby, I do declare," said Mattie, as she
sank exhausted on the first seat with her burden;
and although any one else would have considered
that, judging from the said baby's appearance, such
a statement was decidedly unfounded, Mattie being
small for her own not very advanced age, might, for
obvious reasons, have been excused for making the
rash charge.</p>

<p>"Now, be sure and behave yourselves. Don't get
wild, or touch them pretty flowers, or that man in the
buttons there'll be down on us in a jiffy, and turn us
out quicker than we comed in," said Mattie, when
they had rested and recovered themselves after their
weary trudge. The afternoon waned at last, and the
children turned their steps homeward.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether mammie's comed home; we'll
catch it if she has," said Melie apprehensively.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you be a bothering of your head about
that," replied Mattie sharply, turning upon the child,
who was lagging behind with her little sister.
"Mammie's safe enough, I'll be bound, somewheres
till midnight, and she'll be too dead drunk when she
comes in to do anything but tumble into a corner like
a pig; that's a mercy!"</p>

<p>Melie looked cheered at the information, and
trudged on bravely. Just as they were about to enter
their dingy court, Bob caught sight of a man who
was walking slowly down the road with a placard in
front of him and another behind.</p>

<p>"Mattie, just look at that funny man," he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Oh, haven't you ever seen the likes of him afore?
Wait a minute,&mdash;and I'll see what it says on them
boards," and Mattie read,&mdash;as what girl of her tender
years, however destitute and forlorn, in this age of
educational advantages could not?&mdash;"A Band of
Hope Meeting will be held at the &mdash;&mdash; Road Board
Schools this evening, at half-past six. All children
will be welcome."</p>

<p>"Why, that's my school," said Mattie; "I declare
I should like to go, though what on earth a Band of
Hope Meeting is, goodness knows, for I don't."</p>

<p>"Don't leave us again, Mattie," urged Melie;
"we'll be so lonesome by oursel's."</p>

<p>"Let's see," said Mattie thoughtfully; "it says,
'all children will be welcome.' I've a good mind to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
take the lot of you; and if they won't let us in with
baby, why, we can come back again, I s'pose."</p>

<p>"What a heap of treats we are having, Mattie!
You're a real good 'un!" cried Bob, cutting a
somersault in view of the unusual and delightful
combination of events.</p>

<p>"You, Bob," called Mattie, somewhat ungraciously
it might seem, "stop that, and help Melie along with
Fan."</p>

<p>Tea, which had consisted of the remains from dinner,
being over, a neighbouring church clock chimed the
hour, and Mattie prepared for the evening entertainment.
Baby was sleeping, and resented Mattie's
attempts to remove the worst of the grime from
his face; but she persevered, for she felt that the
credit of the family was entirely in her hands, and she
was not going to risk losing it for the sake of sundry
struggles and tears from its youngest member. They
were all ready at last, and Mattie surveyed the effect
of her handiwork with satisfaction.</p>

<p>"Now, you all jest keep behind me, and don't be
grinning, or up to any of your larks, or they won't
let you in," said Mattie, as they neared the building.</p>

<p>She presented herself before the door with the baby
asleep in her arms, the other children tremblingly
bringing up the rear. A gentleman with a kindly
face was standing near the entrance.</p>

<p>"Do you think you can manage your baby, my
little woman?" he asked, stooping to Mattie.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Bless you, yes, sir. He's better with me than his
own mammie, and'll sleep like a top all the time;
and," she added, glancing behind, "these 'ere little
uns belong to me too, and if you'll let us all in, I'll
see as they behave theirselves."</p>

<p>"I'm very glad to see you all, my dears, come in;"
and, with his heart aching at the revelation of the
misery which was written in unmistakable characters
on the faces of these young children, the gentleman
led them to prominent places near the platform.</p>

<p>Oh, the rich enjoyment of the next hour! The
wonderful music, the fine singing, and the simple
words from the two or three gentlemen who were
there, fell upon Mattie's ears with telling effect, and
after the meeting was over, she exchanged a few
hurried words with Melie and Bob, and then they all
went forward to the table in front of the platform.</p>

<p>"Please, sir," said Mattie to the secretary who sat
there, "you said as any as wanted to sign against
the drink was to come to you after you'd finished
talking; and me, and Melie, and Bob here wants to
sign, only they can't write yet."</p>

<p>"We'll manage that, my dear; but have you thought
about this signing and what it means?"</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, sir; it means as we're never to put our
lips to mammie's drops when we fetch 'em from the
public, and never to touch the drink at all."</p>

<p>"Yes, that's quite right," said the secretary, with a
half smile. "I see you know all about it, and will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
doubtless keep your own pledge; but what about
these little ones? Will they understand and remember
that they mustn't touch the drink when once they've
signed against it?"</p>

<p>"Don't you be a-troubling of yourself about them,
sir; they're little, but they're sharp enough, and I'll
look after 'em," replied the elder sister.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're mother, then?" said the secretary,
glancing compassionately down at the sleeping child
in Mattie's arms.</p>

<p>"Pretty nigh," answered Mattie, concisely. "Tell
me where I've to put my name; and, Melie, you sit
down and hold the baby a minute."</p>

<p>The name was carefully written, and the other
children made crosses in due form, each receiving a
bright pledge-card, which they were told to hang
up in their room; then, after receiving an invitation
to attend another meeting of the same kind the
following week, they left the place.</p>

<p>"Well, we've done something now," said Mattie,
as they emerged into the street. "I'll tell you what,
if we stick to it, as in course we shall, we'll have a
jolly home one day, with no drinking and no beating;
and, Bob, you'll be able to stuff away on the fat of
the land yet."</p>

<p>"Prime!" ejaculated Bob, smacking his lips in
gleeful anticipation of the good time coming.</p>

<p>"We'll get Fan and baby to bed, and then we'll
see about hanging our cards somewheres. They'll not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
fetch anything at the pop-shop, so mammie won't be
carrying 'em off, that's one comfort."</p>

<p>The three cards were presently hung up, affording
a strange contrast to the begrimed and broken walls;
and then the wearied children crept into their corners,
and, on the rags which alone separated them from
the floor, they slept the sleep of innocence and
childhood.</p>

<p>There was a staggering step on the broken stairs
at midnight, and at the familiar sound Mattie woke,
and drew her baby brother closer to her protecting
arms. The door was pushed noisily open, and some
one stumbled across the room, muttering:</p>

<p>"Where's them brats, I wonder?"</p>

<p>Mattie held her breath, and a moment later she
heard a roll on the floor, and knew that her miserable
mother would lie where she had fallen in drunken
slumber until the morning. As for her father, he was
seldom able to mount the stairs; but, if he came home
at all, lay at the foot, until aroused in the morning
by his landlady's shrill tones, and ordered to seek
his own room. So Mattie composed herself to sleep
again; as, under such happy circumstances, what
drunkard's child might not?</p>

<p>She was awoke next morning by the baby's fretful
wail, and, the others beginning to stir, she sat up and
pointed with a warning finger to her still sleeping
mother.</p>

<p>"If you wake her, you'll catch it, you know,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
so hold your noise now, and I'll see if I can't get
something for you to eat," she hoarsely whispered.</p>

<p>With stealthy movement she crept to her mother's
side, and, finding her way to the pocket of her dress,
she put her hand in and drew out a solitary penny.
Holding it up, and nodding delightedly over her prize,
she picked up the baby and disappeared down the
stairs. When she returned there was a good-sized
piece of steaming bread in her hand, and baby was
already ravenously devouring his share.</p>

<p>"Eat it up, quick now, afore she wakes," whispered
Mattie; and the children, nothing loth, soon left not
a crumb to be seen.</p>

<p>"We don't often get such luck as that," chuckled
Mattie, thinking of other times when the need had
been as great, and not even a penny loaf wherewith
to satisfy the cravings of her hungry charge had been
forthcoming.</p>

<p>"Mammie's waking up," whispered Bob, shrinking
back into his corner; and the little group in silence
fixed their fascinated gaze upon the woman to whom
they owed their being, as she yawned and stretched,
and, finally, with a succession of groans, turned over,
and faced her children.</p>

<p>Can it be the same? Are we not doing Susan Dixon
a cruel injustice as we fancy that in yonder bloated face,
with its bleared eyes and framework of dishevelled
hair, we can discover a resemblance to the bright,
happy wife, who, seven years before, had been so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
unsparing in her condemnation of those who, for the
sake of indulging a degraded appetite, wrecked their
own prospects, and blasted the young life and future
happiness of their helpless offspring? Ah, no!
for she, who so proudly had boasted of her own
strength, had also been overcome and laid low by
the mighty tyrant.</p>

<p>Little by little, with many a struggle at first, and
many a fair-sounding promise, did she turn from the
beaten track she had marked out for herself, and in
the security of which she had prided herself, until
now the very desire for a better life seemed hopelessly
crushed with every trace of womanly feeling. She
looked about in a half-stupified fashion for a while,
then raised herself on her elbow, still continuing to
groan.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, mammie?" Mattie ventured
to ask.</p>

<p>"My head's fit to burst, child; you must fetch me
a drop or I shall just go crazy," replied Susan, in
thick, husky tones.</p>

<p>"Where's the money, mammie?" tremblingly asked
the child, well knowing that the last coin had been
spent in their frugal breakfast.</p>

<p>Susan felt in her pocket, and, to Mattie's intense
relief, withdrew her hand, simply saying: "Drat it,
every penny gone again! Just like my luck!"</p>

<p>Her glance went round the room, but there was
absolutely nothing within those four walls which would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
fetch the price of a morning dram. Presently her
eyes rested upon those three bright patches hanging
against the discoloured wall, with a curious expression
of wonder.</p>

<p>"What's them?" she asked at length.</p>

<p>"They're pretty cards as was given us by a gent
yesterday, and he said we was to hang 'em up,"
answered Mattie, wondering what the effect of her
reply would be, and devoutly hoping that, whatever
untimely fate awaited the cards, she and the little
ones might escape with no more than their usual
share of rough and ready treatment.</p>

<p>"Let's look, can't you?" were the next impatient
words; and Mattie took down the three pledges, and,
handing them to her mother, stood patiently by,
awaiting the result of the prolonged investigation.
She was never more surprised than when it came.
Tossing the cards aside, Susan threw her hands over
her face, and rocked herself backwards and forwards
in an agony of shame and remorse, while floods of
tears poured through her fingers.</p>

<p>Mattie bore the sight as long as she could, and
then said: "Don't cry, mammie; if you're bad, I'll
run and fetch the doctor."</p>

<p>But Susan took no notice, and probably had not
heard her child's words. By and bye her tears ceased,
and she staggered to her feet, saying: "Oh, God!
that I should have come to this, while he&mdash;"</p>

<p>What did her grief, her broken words mean? The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
children stood aghast; and, at that juncture, heavy
footsteps were heard on the stairs, and directly the
husband and father entered the room; his clear brow,
fearless eye, and manly bearing all gone, and in their
stead, darkness, sullenness, and feebleness.</p>

<p>"What's these?" he asked, for the gaudy cards had
been thrown to the very entrance of the room, and
in another moment his foot would have rested upon
them.</p>

<p>Mattie sprang forward and placed them, without
a word, in his hands. Susan crossed the room, and
came to her husband's side.</p>

<p>"Who's been putting the brats up to this?" he
asked, half angrily, turning to her.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she answered; "but, oh, George,
look at the signature, and think what that man used
to be, and how we couldn't find a name bad enough for
him; and now he's respectable and well-to-do, and me
and you's sunk lower than ever he did. Oh, dear!
oh, dear!" and again Susan's sobs shook the room.</p>

<p>"Timothy Morris, as I live!" exclaimed George
Dixon, dropping the cards in sheer amazement, while
upon his mind there rushed a score of memories,
some joyous and bright; others, and these of later
days, sad and sin-shadowed.</p>

<p>"Don't carry on so, Susan," he said; "it makes me
feel bad, for I've been as much in the wrong as you."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 251px;">

<span class="caption">&quot;Look at the signature, and think what that man used to be.&quot;&mdash;<i><a href="#Page_76">Page 76</a>.</i></span>
</div>

<p>"Oh, George, I wouldn't care if I'd only cursed
and ruined myself; but look there!" and she pointed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
to the five children, who, half terrified at the scene,
were huddling together in the corner.</p>

<p>"Come here, Mattie," she said; "go to your father,
child, and ask him if he remembers the golden-haired,
bonnie baby who sat on his knee and pulled his hair
when he came home, nigh upon eight years ago, and
told me that the drunken sot, whose name is on your
pledge-card, had turned teetotal. Ask him if you
look like that baby at all. Oh, you needn't turn away,
George, for you know there's but one answer. And
what's made the difference between that happy home,
and this beastly place? and what's made me and you
more like brutes than the loving couple we were, eh,
George?"</p>

<p>With streaming eyes Susan stood before her husband,
waiting for the answer to her questions.</p>

<p>Gnashing his teeth, as if in despair, he hissed out:
"It's the moderate drinking as has worked all the
mischief, woman, if you want to know; and may
God's curse rest upon it!"</p>

<p>Mattie began to understand at length the meaning
of her parents' distress, and hastened to proffer the
only advice that was in her power to give.</p>

<p>"Daddie, mammie," she said, "won't you come and
sign the pledge too? Then you won't never touch
the drink again, and we'll have a nice home; and
me, and Melie, and Bob'll stay with you, and never
run away as we've been a talking of."</p>

<p>Then Melie and Bob came and said: "Oh, please<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
do! We're so hungry and miser'ble all the time;
and if you'll only give up the drink we'll be so good,
and never want any beating."</p>

<p>George looked at Susan across the upturned faces
of the children, and Susan looked back at him wistfully,
earnestly.</p>

<p>"Susan," said George, in low, troubled tones; "if
I promise now, can I ever keep my word? for I'm
raging for a drop this minute."</p>

<p>Susan might have answered, "So am I," but, with
a touch of returning womanliness, she hid her own
suffering that she might minister to the need of the
man who thus confessed his weakness.</p>

<p>"George," she answered steadily, "I had a praying
mother once, and so had you. I once knew how to
pray myself, and so did you; and if ever our mothers'
prayers for us are going to be answered, it'll be now;
and if ever we begin to pray for ourselves again, it'll
be this very minute, or we shall be lost for ever!"
And Susan fell on her knees, and passionately poured
out her whole soul that forgiveness might be granted
to herself and her erring husband, and that to their
weakness and feebleness there might descend the
almighty power and perpetual help of an Omnipotent
Saviour.</p>

<p>Was that prayer answered? Could two souls so
bound and tied by Satan's strongest fetters be loosed
and set free, no longer slaves of a tyrant but children
of a King? Let the new home in a new land, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the subdued brightness of their faces, and the happy
abandonment of their children's glee answer, and say
that once again the captives of the mighty have been
taken away, and the prey of the terrible delivered.</p>

<p>In his own land, Timothy Morris hears, from time
to time, of the well doing of his former neighbours;
and rejoices that he has been the humble instrument
of bringing light and succour to a household which
had been darkened and degraded for years through
the insidious advances of moderate drinking.</p>

<h2>THE COMMITTEE'S DECISION.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 75px;">
<img src="images/i093b-t.png" width="75" height="82" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HE weekly Band of Hope meeting had
been carried on through the long winter
months with vigour and success, and now
on the evening of one of the first spring
days, its committee had met to decide upon the
all-important question as to whether the meetings
should be discontinued through the summer months.</div>

<p>"I certainly think it would be a pity to hold the
meetings on the long bright evenings," said Mr. Jones,
and, judging from the expression on many of the
faces, his opinion was shared by several.</p>

<p>"It would be a downright shame to coop up the
children in a close school-room when they might be
enjoying themselves in the bright sunshine," said
Mr. Gale.</p>

<p>It may be here stated that the committee was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
comprised of equal numbers of abstainers and non-abstainers,
to which latter class the afore-mentioned
speakers belonged. From a corner, a nervous little
man summoned up courage to suggest the possibility
of the younger members of the Band of Hope
breaking their pledge, if they had not a constant
reminder in the shape of their attractive weekly
meeting.</p>

<p>"That goes to prove what is my firm conviction,
that these kind of affairs, popular as they have
become, accomplish little of what they profess to,
for although pledges of total abstinence are taken
from the young folks who attend in large numbers, it
only needs a trivial pretext such as a change of
residence, or the suspension of their meetings, and
they become forgetful of the pledge which they have
signed," said a prominent member of the committee.</p>

<p>"You are quite right, my dear sir," replied a
middle-aged gentleman beside him; "as I can testify
by my own experience. When I was a lad of seven
or eight, I attended a Band of Hope meeting. Like
all children, I was readily influenced by others, and
as most of the little folks who attended signed the
pledge, I did the same. Two or three years afterwards
my parents moved out of the neighbourhood, and
it never occurred to my childish mind that I was just
as much bound to keep my pledge as though I had
still been attending the meeting where I signed it.
So I partook with my brothers and sisters of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
daily stimulant which found its way to our table,
to the amusement of my father, who had looked
upon my previous self-denial as a boyish whim."</p>

<p>"I believe your experience is by no means an
isolated one," added another member, complacently
stroking his beard; "I myself joined at least two
Bands of Hope when I was a youngster; but I don't
belong to the cold-water ranks to-day."</p>

<p>"Come, gentlemen, we are not here to discuss
whether the Band of Hope answers the end it has in
view; but whether it is advisable to give its juvenile
members a long summer vacation. Will one of you
make a proposition? and we will take the vote of the
meeting," said the chairman.</p>

<p>The nervous member made an uneasy movement,
and looked anxiously around, but before he could
summon up courage to open his mouth, a gentleman,
who had hitherto remained silent, rose, and commenced
to speak.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman," he began, "I had no intention of
making my voice heard when I came into this
meeting, but my soul is too deeply stirred to allow
me to preserve silence. Sir, it has been suggested
that Bands of Hope accomplish little of what they
profess to do, and in proof of that, two of our
non-abstaining friends have readily confessed that in
their boyhood they were associated with Bands of
Hope. Sir, there doubtless is a percentage of children
who carelessly or ignorantly take upon themselves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
these solemn vows, and fail to fulfil them. I may add
that to my knowledge, many a drunkard has gone
down to his dishonoured grave uttering the impotent
wish that he had kept the pledge of his childhood.
But, sir, I am in a position to say that such percentage
is very small, and that the juvenile temperance
movement in this country is doing a mighty work.
We are saving the children, and sending into many a
sin-darkened home, the little ones as messengers of
hope and salvation. And not alone into poverty-stricken
courts and alleys, but into abodes of the
better classes where the drink demon has asserted his
supremacy, do our youthful members find their way.
Yet, sir, I am not ashamed to say, that these children
need the reminder of their weekly meeting. They
are but weak, and temptation is oftentimes strong,
whether conveyed to them by the sight and smell
of the intoxicants which many of them have to fetch,
or, as in the case of our friend who has spoken,
placed upon the well-spread table within their easy
reach. Sir, if for the summer months we could
compel the publicans, and all who are licensed to sell
alcohol in any shape or form, to close their premises,
and take a long vacation, and could we during that
time banish from the homes of our land every
temptation to strong drink, then we might afford to
give up our meetings for the next few months; but
while the monster Intemperance is ceaselessly devastating
homes and blighting lives in all classes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
communities, let us not dream of giving our endeavours
to meet and vanquish the strong man armed
a summer holiday."</p>

<p>The speaker wiped his brow and sat down, and
significant glances went round the room. When a
minute later the votes were taken, there were found
to be only two members who did not cordially agree
with the proposal that the meetings of the Band of
Hope should be continued all through the year.</p>

<p>The question was addressed by a stalwart labouring
man to his wife, as he stood in the doorway of his
little cottage, one of a few that nestled at the foot of
one of the Yorkshire hills, and from which could
be seen stretching yet further below, the smoky
chimneys of a large manufacturing town, in such as
which England's wealth and commercial prosperity
are so largely centred.</p>

<p>"Lad, thee moight well woonder at a wicked wench
loike thy lass talkin' o' gettin' saaved; ay, and thee<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
may sneer as mooch as thee loikes; aw mun reeap as
aw ha' sowed, and aw deserve thy haard woords, and

aw mun saay ter thee 'at, He who saaved t' thief on
t' cross caanst saave a big sinner loike me; ay, and
keep me from t' swearin' and t' drinkin'," answered his
wife, who was busily engaged in sweeping a filthy
floor, preparatory to bestowing upon the blackened
stones a hearty scrubbing.</p>

<p>"Weel, aw'll not heender thee, loike some 'ud do, if
thee'll't see ter my comforts as thou hast t' mornin',"
replied John Ibbetson, thinking with satisfaction of
the unaccustomed luxury of a well-prepared breakfast,
which had been awaiting him on his arrival from his
work close by, at an early hour, that same morning.
Pursuing his way thither again, he thought of the
strange events that had been crowded into a short
space of time. The invitation to the preaching of
an evangelist in the Mission Room on the hill-side,
that had been given to his wife yesterday morning;
the call of a kindly-disposed neighbour, who herself
regularly attended the little room, just before the
evening service commenced; and then the sight he
had witnessed of the neat, respectable neighbour, and
his ill-clothed, dirty wife, going up the hill together.
He thought of the strange scene that met his view
on his return to his home after spending the evening
hours as usual with a neighbour, smoking and
conversing on the topics of the day, for John prided<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
himself that his figure had never darkened the doorway
of the wretched tavern that was his wife's
continual resort.</p>

<p>"T' lass knows all about t' inside o' t' beastly plaace,
and 'at's enoogh for me," he would say in reply to any
invitation from its many frequenters to join them in
their social evenings. He never went nearer than
when compelled. Occasionally he waited at some
little distance for the stumbling figure of his wife, in
order to help her along the solitary path that led to
their miserable dwelling. But no such task lay before
him when he left his neighbour's cheerful fireside;
neither was his wife lying in a state of helpless
intoxication across the bed; nor was she even sitting
muddled and stupified, waiting his arrival to make the
cottage resound with her oaths, when he should refuse
to supply her with the means for further revelry and
drunken debauch. In the usually empty grate
a glowing fire shed its warmth and radiance through
the room; on the table there was a jug of steaming
coffee, and a pile of bread and butter; and, strangest
of all, on the well-swept hearth were his dilapidated
slippers warmed and ready, and close beside them his
chair, evidently drawn from its corner in expectation
of his arrival. Half suspicious of some new design
against his peace, he looked dubiously around, and
only ventured to say: "Thou'rt home early, lass,
t' neaght?"</p>

<p>"Ay, lad, thou sayest it; and more's t' shame, 'at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
aw've ever been aught but hoom ter greeat thee;
aw've gotten good oop at yond meetin' hoose t' neaght,
and aw've proomised t' Looard and t' fouks 'at aw'll

woife ter thee, and a weecked mother ter t' childer; but
t' Looard in mercy ha' forgi'en me all my seens; and
aw'm 'at happy aw could daance for t' joy. Dost
heear me, lad?" she continued, as her husband stared
in dumbfounded fashion at her.</p>

<p>"Thee may weel stare thee een oot wi' wonner, for
aw waalked streeaght ter t' tap yonder, and thinkin'
ter mysen, now t' Looard ha' weshed my blaack heaart
t' least aw could do 'ud be t' wesh my blaack faace, aw

<p>"Lass, if 'at thee's been saayin' be true, then aw
mun saay t' Looard, aboot whom thee taalks so glib, 'll
ha' His haands full to keeap thee oot o' meescheef for
a while; it's a seaght more nor aw could do," said
John, at length finding his voice.</p>

<p>"Thou'rt reaght enoogh, lad; but His hands are aye
poowerful, so aw'm toold. Maybe, thee 'ud goo ter
t' chapel wi' me to-morrow neaght, and hear t' preachin';
it's wonnerful and foine," and then Jane handed
a steaming cup of coffee to her husband, and waited
his reply with some trepidation, for, in her simple
soul, there had already sprung up the desire, sure
proof of the reality of the Spirit's work in any heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
that another should partake of the new life that had
come to her.</p>

<p>"See thee, lass; thee'lt just stop 'at koind o' taalk:
aw'll not goo to yond plaace coom a greeat while;
thee'lt have ter show t' work's reeal wi' thee, afore thee
sees me walkin' oop t' hill aside o' thee; aw've no
drinkin', swearin' waays ter gi'e o'er, thee knows,"
said John.</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, John, 'at's true, and thou'st been paatient
and forbearin' wi' me, and wi' God's help, aw'll mak'
thee a better woife in t' future, and mebbe when thou
see'st what religion's done for me, thou'lt tak' thy
waay wi' me oop to yond little room," hopefully
replied Sarah.</p>

<p>Well might John Ibbetson pursue his way as in
a dream, with such a new experience of domestic
comfort to engage his thoughts; yet, reaching the
farm on which he worked, he drew a deep sigh as he
turned to his ploughing, and muttered: "Ay, it
proomises fair, but t' lass'll never hoold oot aw'm
feared."</p>

<p>"Lad," said his wife, as they sat at tea before the
shining grate; "thou'lt not saay aught agaainst me
gooin' to t' meetin' to-noight; aw'm but weeak, and
t' seaght o' t' happy faaces oop yonder'll do me
a power o' good; aw'll settle doon to spend t'neaghts
wi' thee, if thou wilt, by and bye."</p>

<p>"Go where thou wilt, and welcoom, lass, if 'twill
help thee to keeap from t' alehouse," replied John, too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
wise to utter the surprise that nearly overwhelmed
him on hearing his hitherto unmanageable wife appeal
to him for permission to spend the evening away
from her home, the claims of which had been so
completely disregarded by her in the past.</p>

<p>As the weeks went by John's fears respecting his
wife's steadfastness seemed likely to be unrealised;
for, under the inspiration of her new life, the home,
her children, and herself underwent a thorough
reformation, and her husband began to breathe freely
as he marked the visible signs of the change in his
wife's heart. But many a wise head was significantly
shaken, and many a sage tongue whispered: "Bide
a while, and ye'll see it 'll all end i' smooke;
Saarah Ann Ibbetson's looved her coops too weel to
gi'e un oop in sooch a hurry."</p>

<p>It was Sunday evening, and Mrs. Ibbetson was
seated beside her fireside, spelling out with great pains
the last part of the chapter which had been read
before the sermon at chapel that night. It was the
ninth chapter of St. Mark's Gospel, and she had
commenced at the thirtieth verse, but had not found
the passage which had troubled and surprised her
whilst hearing it read; but travelling down the verses
with her forefinger pointing to each line, lest her eye,
unaccustomed to the task, should mislead her, and
some of the sacred words be passed over unread, at
last she reached the forty-third verse.</p>

<p>"It's un!" she triumphantly exclaimed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh, but it's a haard un!" was her verdict when
she had finished it; "Aw 'll raad un agaain;" and
she read: "And if thy hand offend thee, cut it off:
it is better for thee to enter into life maimed, than
having two hands to go into hell, into the fire that
never shall be quenched."</p>

<p>She put the Bible away, and gazing into the fire,
mused aloud: "Aw'm daazed aboot yond text; aw
never heeard loike on't; but aw'm thinkin' it's only
fair; if t' reet hand offeends cut un off, and serve
un reet too. T' blessed Looard, He knows all
about it, He does, and He'd raather see His childer
waalk inter t' glory wi' one hand than know they'd
gone doon inter yond daarkness wi' their two seenful
hands ter burn ter all 'ternity; ay, it's plaain enoogh
for a poor eegnorant lass loike mysen to get un,"
and having settled the difficult question to her
own satisfaction, without the aid of commentators,
Sarah Ann rose and bustled about getting her
husband's supper.</p>

<p>John Ibbetson was hurrying home one night shortly
after the above occurrences pleasantly anticipating
the now usual sight of a clean hearth, a waiting
supper, and a welcoming wife; but pushing open the
door he found the room in total darkness, and on
striking a light he saw it was unoccupied.</p>

<p>"Maybe t' lass 'as grown weary and gone ter bed,"
said John to himself, resolutely turning from a
horrible fear that fell coldly on his heart. Taking up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
the candle he stepped into the sleeping room, but the
bed was undisturbed, and he came back into the
kitchen, muttering: "T' chapel's all daark and
cloosed, where can t'lass be? anyhow aw'll gi'e a look
roound," and taking up his hat, John passed into the
darkness without. Shrieks and shouts, alas! too well
known to be mistaken, fell on his ear. Hastening
forward he took his wife from the hands of those who
were bringing her towards her home; but she broke
from him, and staggering on with uncertain footsteps,
entered the cottage first. He relit the candle, then
facing her with folded arms and a stern brow, as she
dropped into a chair, he said: "So thee'st been at
t' cursed drink agaain, after all t' foine proomises, and
thee a-foolin me, poor daft un 'at I be, to a' gi'en ear
ter all thou'st had ter say. What deevil has been
temptin' thee, lass, to-neet, to forget all t' chapel
goin' and t' friends who ha' looked after thee so
weel?"</p>

<p>But the only answer that Sarah Ann seemed
capable of making was the reiteration: "Aw've got
ter cut un off, lad; aw'll cut un off, t' wicked haand;"
and the poor woman struck at the offending member
with such savage force, that her husband interfered
and dragged her in sullen despair to her bed.</p>

<p>He awoke the next morning with a burden on his
heart that he could not account for, until the recollection
of the events of the previous night flashed into
his mind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh, but she's a reet down bad un; what's t' use
o' me pullin' one waay, and her t' other; t' poor
childer's just dragged oop by t' hair o' t' head; aw'll
ha' no more on't, aw've gi'en her her chances o'er and
o'er, but she's coom ter t' end o' tether at laast;
t' wicked hussy shaal goo," the poor fellow groaned;
and with this resolve firmly fixed in his mind, he
turned out of bed, and betook himself to the kitchen.
There, to his unbounded astonishment, was his wife,
whom he had missed, sitting beside the fire, with her
arms folded in her apron, and bearing on her face the
impress of keen suffering. On the table there was a
cup and saucer placed for him, and the kettle was
hissing and steaming on the glowing coals.</p>

<p>"Tak' summat afore thee goos to woork, lad; aw
caan't help thee mysen, till t' pain's a bit o'er," said
Sarah Ann in a trembling voice, watching her
husband's face in evident fear.</p>

<p>"Aw want nought ter eat; thou'lt not soft sooap
me so eaasy," replied John, gruffly; but looking at her
again, he said: "What's the maatter wi' thee noo?"</p>

<p>"See thee, lad," and the woman uncovered her
apron, and revealed a sickening sight; a right hand,
blackened, shrivelled, and quivering with the torture
of the fiery ordeal through which it had been made
to pass.</p>

<p>Strong man though he was, John Ibbetson staggered
back in horror.</p>

<p>"Lass," gasped he, with his eyes yet riveted, spell-bound,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
on the hideous spectacle; "lass, what hast
thee done wi' t' poor haand?"</p>

<p>"Fetch yond Bible from t' shelf, lad, and read
t' neanth chaapter o' Maark, and t' forty-third verse."</p>

<p>John obeyed, and read aloud the verse which had
been the subject of his wife's meditations a few
Sabbath evenings before.</p>

<p>"Noo, lad, aw'll tell thee all aboot it. Thee'd just
goon ter woork yester morn, when Emma Ward
stepped in, and 'Lass,' she said, 'thee mun coom oop
t' hill wi' me, for Jim Green's little un's deein', and
t' mother's well nigh craazed;' thee knows aw couldn't
be unneeboorloike, so aw good, and gi'ed a helpin'
haand, and they o'er persuaded me ter tak' a glass o'
waarm speerit to keep t' cold oot, and I set my faace
against it at first, but it looked so temptin', at aw stretched
oot t' reet haand and finished glaas cleean off,
and coomin' hoom, deevil, he saaid: 'thee ud best feenish
oop at t' ale-hoose,' and aw were paarched for more o'
cursed stoof, and t' knows t' rest; and coom t' morn, aw
saaid, 'Aw'll cut un off, t' reet haand 'at took glaass,
for aw'll goo inter t' kingdom maimed sooner aw'll goo
to yond plaace o' daarkness wi' my two haands,' and
aw'd gotten t' axe ter chop un off, when aw thowt o'
thee and the childer, and how thee and them 'ud miss
t' haand, and aw coomd baack ter kitchen, and said:
'Aw'll gi'en a good lesson, anyhow; aw'll gi'en a taaste
o' t' fire as'll mind un o' t' fire 'at burns for aye', and
aw put un in and held un in, and thee 'lt ha'e ter see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
ter thy own meals coom a while, and if t' nasty thing
offends again aw'll cut un off, and thee'lt ha' ter do
t' best thee can for thysen, for aw've promised to mind
all t' Book says;" and Sarah Ann turned the apron
carefully over the poor maimed hand, and rocked
herself to and fro, in her cruel pain.</p>

<p>"Thee's a braave lass; and if thou'rt gooin' ter
turn t' faace from t' drink agaain, aw'll hould on ter
thee, and help thee; but thee'st been reeadin' t' Bible
oopside doon, aw reeckon; aw never heeard tell o'
fouks maimin' theirsens in looike faashion; thee'ud
best get paarson ter mak' t' verse reet;" and John
walked away to his work with new thoughts stirring
in his breast; and a tenderness, to which it had long
been a stranger, swelling within his heart at the
remembrance of his suffering wife, who was so
earnest in her purpose of breaking through the
power of evil habit, and, at all costs, finding her
way into the kingdom of heaven.</p>

<p>"T' lass shall not goo alone," was his decision at
length, and John Ibbetson made up his mind that
next Sabbath he and his wife would walk up the hill
in company, and for the first time since their marriage,
enter the house of God together.</p>

<p>The news spread like wildfire through the village
that "John Ibbetson's lass had well-nigh burned her
hand ter t' bone for tamperin' wi' t' drink agaain;" and
in the forenoon of the same day, the neighbour who
had persuaded Sarah Ann to accompany her to that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
special service where a new life had dawned for her
some months before, called to see what truth there
was in the tale.</p>

<p>As soon as she had entered the door Mrs. Ibbetson
greeted her.</p>

<p>"Aw thowt thee 'ud coom, Jane; hast t' heard aw
got at t' drink last een? but," she said, holding up her
mutilated hand in triumph, "Aw've gi'ed un a good
waarmin' for its sen."</p>

<p>"Eh, but it's an awfu' burnin'!" exclaimed the
neighbour; "dost think, thou poor lass, at 'll keep
thee from t' drink?"</p>

<p>"If it doesn't, then aw mun cut un off, for t' Book
saays it, and aw'm bound to mind what t' Book
saays," answered Mrs. Ibbetson.</p>

<p>"Saarah Ann," said her startled neighbour; "If
thee thinks 'at t' good Looard bids thee hurt and
maim thysen, thou'st maade a mistaak."</p>

<p>"Nay, Jane, didn't preacher saay t' other neet
from t' Book: 'If t' reet haand offeend thee, cut un
off'? ay, and aw foound un, and reead un mysen
when aw coomed hoom, and it's no mistaake, lass,"
said Mrs. Ibbetson eagerly.</p>

<p>"But thee hast maade an awfu' mistaake, Saarah
Ann; t' wooards be there, sure enoogh, but they
doan't mean fowks mun goo cuttin' and hackin' at
their own flesh. T' blessed Looard were poonished
for t' sin o' t' world, and we've no reet ter be thinkin'
we mun poonish oursen for our fro'ard waays."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Puzzled and dumbfounded, poor Sarah Ann looked
at her visitor for a while, and then asked despondingly:</p>

<p>"And what do yond woords mean, Jane?"</p>

<p>"Aw'll mak' it plaain ter thee, Saarah Ann; see
here! t' knows t' good o' t' reet haand; thee never
puts t' left ter aught if t' reet 'll do t' wooark, and
t' Looard knows there be many a sin 'at's loike t' reet
haand ter His fouks, and there's many a fouk as 'ud
saay o' t' drunkin', swearin' waays: 'Aw can't gi'e un
oop; aw mun ha'e a drop, or rap oot t' oath soom
while, and t' good Looard 'll forgi'e un and let un inter
t' kingdom by and bye;' but what does t' good
Looard saay?"</p>

<p>"Cut un off, cut un off," called out Sarah Ann, who
had been hanging on her neighbour's interpretation
with open mouth.</p>

<p>"Ay, lass, thee sees it, and thee mun be willin' to
cut un off before t' Looard 'll gi'e thee His forgiveness,
and let thee inter t' kingdom o' His graace below;
thee knows now 'at He never meant t' poor haand ter
suffer for t' sin o' t' soul; if thee sins thee 'lt suffer; but
thou mun never tak' t' poonishment o' thysen agaain;
thou'lt cut off t' drink, lass; thou mun promise 'at ter
t' Looard and t' fouks."</p>

<p>"Ay, ay, Jane, aw'll promise 'at! aw'm not loike
to forget coom a greeat while wi' t' hand ter mind
me," said Sarah Ann, looking regretfully down at the
useless member.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aw'll see to curin' un; aw've soom rare ointment
oop at hoom; aw'll fetch un, and then aw'll coom and
redd oop for thee;" and so saying Jane left the
house, and sore as her bodily anguish was, Sarah Ann
knelt and thanked the Lord that He had borne the
punishment for all her sins; and once more, in a very
ignorant fashion, doubtless, but in earnestness and
singleness of purpose, she gave herself to Him to be
kept from her besetting sins; promising, in His
strength, to "cut un off," now and for ever, and we
are glad to say the promise was faithfully kept.</p>

<p>When her neighbour returned with healing appliances,
she listened with heart-felt praises on her
own lips to the song of praise that was being raised,
and joined in words that to her had long been sweetly
familiar:</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br />HAT was a fine sermon, Herbert! A
masterpiece of eloquence and forceful
teaching combined," said Mrs. Green
to her husband, as they walked home
one Sunday morning after service.</div>

<p>A look of pain crossed the good deacon's face, and
he answered:</p>

<p>"I have news which will surprise you, Mary. My
own suspicion and that of my brother deacons has
been fully confirmed this morning."</p>

<p>"What suspicion," asked Mrs. Green quickly.</p>

<p>"That our pastor has for some time past given way
to the allurements of strong drink."</p>

<p>"Oh, that is too dreadful! it cannot be true; so
good, devoted, and holy a man as I have always
thought him to be!"</p>

<p>"It is certainly true. Unfortunately, drink spares<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
none, and the more noble and exalted its victims, the
more sure and complete is their downfall. It will
seem incredible to you; but the truth is, Mr. Harris
preached this morning under the influence of
liquor. He had been drinking before he came into
the vestry, and was trembling and scarcely able to
stand. He said he had been suffering with neuralgia,
and asked for a glass of wine to steady his nerves.
I said, 'Excuse me, Mr. Harris, it is painfully apparent
that you have already indulged too freely in stimulant.'
He looked convicted, and covered his face; but
presently stammered out something about his excessive
intellectual labours compelling him to resort
to alcohol. Mr. Shaw then said: 'We would far
rather listen to simpler preaching, Mr. Harris, than
know that your brilliant discourses are composed and
delivered under the stimulus of wine.' He promised
to be more careful in the future; but declared that it
was quite impossible for him to face the large congregation
unless he could gain a little self-command;
and truly he was in a pitiable condition. It was close
upon service time, and there was no alternative but to
give him more wine. To my surprise, immediately
afterwards he mounted the pulpit stairs steadily, and
conducted the service, as you know, with the utmost
propriety. But we are resolved that he must either
give up the practice of taking stimulant, or leave the
church."</p>

<p>"Oh, Herbert! I'm overwhelmed. Mr. Harris has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
helped me in my spiritual life as no one else has, and
it seems impossible that he could give way to such an
awful sin as drunkenness," and Mrs. Green dashed
away the tears of sympathy that had fallen, and
resolved to hope and pray that her beloved pastor
might break from the fatal habit which was making
him its victim. But months went by, and Mr. Harris
was found to be indulging in still deeper excess, until
the story of his downfall was on every lip. Again
and again he vowed reformation, and before God and
his people humbled himself; but he lacked the needful
courage to put the poisonous cup entirely away.
"I must take a little, only a little," he said, and that
little continually asserted its power to entice and
ensnare. Couched in terms of Christian sympathy
and forbearance, his dismissal from the flock, over
whom for years he had tenderly watched, came at
length. He was sitting in his study bending over
it in remorse and shame when a knock was heard
at his door, and a brother minister entered.</p>

<p>"Just in time to witness my degradation," he
exclaimed bitterly. "Look here, Shafton! it has
come to this! What will become of my wife and
children now?"</p>

<p>The Rev. Ernest Shafton laid his hand upon the
shoulder of his brother, perused in silence the official
paper before him, and then walked to the window.
Deeply cogitating, he stood there for some time, while
Mr. Harris's face grew darker, and he muttered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
"Turned against me, like every one else! Well, it's
my own doing."</p>

<p>"Harris," said Mr. Shafton, suddenly, "do you
know what this means for you, my poor fellow?"</p>

<p>"Ruin, I suppose," was the gloomy answer.</p>

<p>"Ay, ruin for time and eternity&mdash;having preached
to others to become yourself a castaway; but you
will not suffer alone, Harris. Your gentle, refined
wife will be plunged from comfort to penury; your
beautiful, promising children will know the cruel
shifts of poverty; will hear their father's name uttered
in accents of contempt by a scoffing world; will
watch his downward career with fear and loathing,
and yet, oh! mark my words, will probably follow in
his footsteps, drag out miserable existences, and
eventually fill drunkards' graves."</p>

<p>"God forbid! God forbid! anything but that,"
exclaimed the startled minister, rising in great
agitation and pacing the room.</p>

<p>"God does forbid; but you Harris, are paving
your children's road to ruin. Come, I have a proposal
to make. By God's help, I will save you if you will
let me."</p>

<p>"Do what you will, I am ready to submit to anything,"
groaned the trembling man.</p>

<p>"I will use all my influence to change this dismissal
into a long suspension of duties. Meanwhile, you
shall leave your home and come and stay with me,
and I will stand beside you while you fight in God's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
strength against your foe; but, my brother, you must
pledge yourself to abstain from all intoxicants, now
and for ever. Say, are you resolved, for the sake
of your wife and children, and your own eternal
happiness, to put the accursed thing beneath your
feet?"</p>

<p>There was a solemn pause, and in the silence a
woman's step crossed the floor, and gentle hands
twined round the erring man's neck.</p>

<p>"Jessie, help me, decide for me now," he cried.</p>

<p>Ernest Shafton repeated his proposal to the wife,
asking if she would second his efforts to save her
husband, by her willing consent to leave him in the
care of his friend for a year, or longer if needful, until
his reformation were effected.</p>

<p>"A year, did you say? a lifetime, if necessary," was
the instant reply. Stooping to her husband's ear she
whispered, "Go, dear Henry, and in God's strength
fight and conquer. Let no regretful thought turn
towards me, for I shall be content.</p>

<div class='poem'>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">"'While thee I see</span><br />
Living to God, thou art alive to me!'"<br />
</div>

<p>"You are an angel, Jessie!" exclaimed the man,
holding his wife's hands and falling on his knees.
Cries for forgiveness for the past and help for the
future broke from him as he knelt, and his prayer was
heard and answered. In years that followed he
looked back upon that memorable hour as the
turning-point in his history, and thanked God for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
friendly hand that was reached out to save a brother
from the abyss which yawned at his feet. Once
again he filled an honoured position as the pastor
of a large and influential church. Once again he
passed in and out of the houses of the people, the
beloved friend and ready helper of rich and poor;
but in addition to former labours he became everywhere
known as the advocate of Total Abstinence for
young and old, and so persistent were his efforts in
this direction, that many of the deacons and influential
men of his church became rigid adherents of
the good cause.</p>

<p>"Sir," said one upon whom all the pastor's arguments
had apparently been wasted; "Mr. Harris,
why can't you let us non-abstainers alone? Let us
go our way, and we will accord you the same liberty
of action."</p>

<p>Mr. Harris's brow clouded with some painful
recollection, and he said with much feeling: "You
compel me to refer to the past. Allow me very
tenderly, but faithfully to remind you that you did
not accord me 'liberty of action' in times gone
by."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" inquired the astonished
deacon.</p>

<p>"Forgive me for seeming to be ungrateful for the
kindness which alone prompted you; but, oh, my
dear friend, remember how in years, that, thank God,
are past, you and your brother deacons, equally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hospitable and kind-hearted, never allowed me to
decline your offer of wine or spirits. If I paid you
a call before preaching, you insisted that I needed to
be stimulated for my work, and pressed me to accept
the best wine your cellars could supply. If I dropped
in on my way home, I was sure to be looking white
and exhausted, and must therefore take 'just one
glass' to restore my energies. Heat and cold, rain
and sunshine, joy and sorrow, all afforded you an
excuse for compelling me to partake of the fatal cup.
Your wines found their way to my table in abundance.
Many a time I sought to refuse your false kindness;
but you know how deeply I should have grieved
you if I had not accepted your hospitality. From
the day I first entered upon my pastorate as a
moderate drinker, I felt that it was considered a
personal slight if I visited any house and refused the
proffered wine. Can you wonder that I grew to feel
it a necessity? that presently I stumbled and fell, and
for a time was 'out of the way through strong drink'?
Oh, my brother, let me beg, that, if you cannot
banish intoxicants from your home, you will at least
refrain from pressing them upon others, lest you
cause a weaker brother to offend."</p>

<p>Deeply agitated, the deacon wrung his pastor's
hand, abruptly leaving him with the broken words:
"Forgive me&mdash;I&mdash;didn't mean&mdash;didn't know&mdash;you've
won me over at last."</p>

<p>"What is the matter, my dear?" asked Mrs. Green<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
in alarmed tones, as a few minutes later her husband
entered the room where she was working, and
throwing himself into a chair, buried his face in his
hands. The deacon only groaned. "Surely there is
nothing wrong with our minister again," said his wife,
knowing that her husband had recently been in the
company of Mr. Harris.</p>

<p>"No, no, and if so, I, and such as I, would have been
to blame, as we were years ago, God forgive us!"
Mrs. Green looked at her husband, half-believing that
under some sudden strain his mind had lost its
balance.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? It was Mr. Harris's own
fault that he gave way to drink, and you should
remember that you and his other deacons were
faithful in your constant warnings and long-suffering
with him beyond what might have been expected."</p>

<p>"We, and only we, caused his downfall, and then
reproached him for the disgrace he had brought upon
our church," gloomily responded the deacon.</p>

<p>"You are speaking in enigmas; do explain yourself,
Herbert," impatiently urged his wife.</p>

<p>In answer, Mr. Green repeated the words of his
pastor, which had made so deep an impression upon
his own mind. When he had finished he looked up
to find that his wife's tears were dropping upon the
work which had fallen from her hands.</p>

<p>"Oh, how guilty we have been, Herbert! Well do
I remember how persistent I always was in my offers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of stimulant to our minister in years gone by, and
when he declined I pretended to be hurt, and said he
must not refuse anything a lady offered, for she would
be sure to know what was good for her guest; and
then when I conquered, and he reluctantly took the
glass from my hands, I felt so exultant, and all the
while I was luring him on to the ruin, which might
have been eternal."</p>

<p>Mrs. Green broke down utterly, and there was a
suspicious huskiness in her husband's voice as he
spoke: "Yes, we are indeed guilty, and we may have
been no less so in many other instances. Verily, the
blood of souls is on our garments. Mary, what shall
we do?"</p>

<p>"Can you ask, Herbert? I don't mind how
inhospitable it may appear; but I am resolved never
again to offer stimulants to our guests, lest I make
the same fatal mistake."</p>

<p>"That is well said, my dear; but&mdash;but&mdash;shall we
agree to refrain from offering intoxicants to callers,
and the visitors who occasionally sit at our table, lest
we place temptation in their way, while every day
those dearer than our life sit and partake with us
of the cup which I now believe to possess such fatal
allurements? If we have decided no longer to tempt
our guests, shall we continue to tempt our innocent
children, to whom we stand in their early years as
their sole medium of light and knowledge? Think,
Mary, if a few years hence one of our boys could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
truthfully say to us what our pastor has just
said."</p>

<p>"Don't say any more; I can't bear it, Herbert."</p>

<p>For a few moments there was silence. Then Mrs.
Green spoke again: "There is only one step to be
taken; from this day all intoxicants must be banished
from our home. Neither our children nor our friends
must ever have further opportunity of stumbling over
our well-meaning but cruel kindness. God, who
knows how blindly and ignorantly we have sinned in
the past, will surely grant His forgiving mercy to us,
and help us in the future to wage successful battle
against this subtle foe who has had, till now, his
acknowledged place in our house."</p>

<p>"Thank God for that decision; my heart already
feels lighter. From this time I will take my stand
beside Mr. Harris in his noble Temperance work, and
so far as I can, help to repair the wrong we have done
him. May God speed our efforts!"</p>

<p>"Amen!" reverently whispered Mrs. Green.</p>

<h2>TIM MALONEY'S PIG.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 84px;">
<img src="images/o-quote.png" width="84" height="82" alt="&quot;O" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />CH, thin, mate, an' yer don't appair to be
takin' kindly to yer wark the morn!
Shure, an' I'm rale 'shamed uv ye,
afther yer day's plasurin'," remarked
Tim Maloney, a broad-shouldered, good-tempered
looking Irishman, to his fellow-workman, who, with
sundry grunts and ejaculations expressive of discontent
with the world in general, and his own hard-working
existence in particular, had just lazily emptied his
hod of bricks at the feet of Tim, who was briskly
disposing of them, with many dexterous pats and
turns of his trowel, as he laid them, one by one, upon
the wall he was engaged in building. It was early
in the morning of the day following a public holiday;
and, of all the workmen employed upon the block
of houses in course of erection, only Tim Maloney
and John Jarvis had made their appearance, the latter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
of whom seemed none the better for the previous
day's cessation from toil.</div>

<p>He answered gloomily:</p>

<p>"All very well for the likes of you, Tim Maloney,
to be chaffin' a feller; but I'd like to know if you'd
feel fit to kill yerself with work if you'd been draggin'
about the day afore with the missis a scoldin', and
half a dozen brats at yer heels as gave yer no peace,
a spendin' of yer hard-earned money, and seein'
nought for it."</p>

<p>Tim picked up a brick, and placed it tenderly in
the mortar bed he had just prepared, then said:</p>

<p>"An' isn't it bacomin' that the wife uv yer bossum
and the childer should share yer holiday, an' hilp yer
to spind yer money, me bhoy?"</p>

<p>"I can't say as it isn't," frankly replied John; "but
some wives is different to others; and mine just nags
and worrits and gives a feller no peace of his life, and
the children takes after her."</p>

<p>"Shure, an' what does she nag and worrit ye about
thin?" asked Tim, with a twinkle in his eye; but at
that moment John shouldered his empty hod and
disappeared.</p>

<p>"The ould sthory, shure an' certin," muttered Tim,
and in his honest, kindly heart, for the hundredth time,
revolved many a scheme for helping and stimulating
his fellow-workman to a better life.</p>

<p>The breakfast bell presently rang, and John Jarvis,
who lived at a little distance, threw himself at full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
length upon some boards, grumbling at his wife for
being late with his breakfast.</p>

<p>"Maybe she's wearied herself wid followin' ye an'
yer half dozen brats yester," dryly suggested Tim, as
he threw down his trowel and strode away to his
cottage home close by, where a plentiful meal awaited
him. Certainly, when he met Mrs. Jarvis the next
minute, she looked sufficiently white and fagged to
justify his suggestion.</p>

<p>"Mornin' to ye," he said, nodding and hurrying by.</p>

<p>But Tim's cottage lay in Mrs. Jarvis's homeward
way, and as her lagging footsteps passed the door,
the buxom form of Tim's wife appeared.</p>

<p>"Come in, an' rist ye a spell, Mrs. Jarvis; ye look
more fit for yer bed nor to be draggin' about at all,
at all."</p>

<p>"It's just what I am. I'm sure I don't know
what's coming to me," exclaimed Mrs. Jarvis, as she
dropped into a chair.</p>

<p>"Give her a dhrop uv tay, Peggy, an' she'll ravive
a bit," said Tim.</p>

<p>"You're very kind, Tim. Why, this tea is real
good, as good as what the gentry drinks. I feel quite
a different creature after it, I declare;" and Mrs. Jarvis
presently set down her empty cup with a surprised
air.</p>

<p>"I can't think how you manage, Mrs. Maloney.
Here's your husband earning the same wages as mine,
yet you can afford to live a sight better than us;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
you're better dressed too, and what a fine place you've
got; and isn't that pig in the garden yours?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis's eyes had roamed from the bright, clean
kitchen, through the open window to the well-stocked
garden, where, in a corner, stood a sty, the occupant
of which was rooting and grunting in the manner
peculiar to his kind.</p>

<p>"Indade, an' ye're rayte; a fine porker he is too.
I'll sind ye up a bit whin we kill, an' ye shall tasthe
for yerself."</p>

<p>"Thank you kindly, Tim. It's not often we can
afford to indulge in a bit of bacon now. Times are
so hard, you see," returned Mrs. Jarvis, with a look
of still deeper perplexity upon her face as she rose
to go.</p>

<p>Tim whispered to his wife who nodded, and then
turned to Mrs. Jarvis, saying:</p>

<p>"Now, don't ye be thrudgin' up wid yer husban's
bit uv dinner. My Tim'll bring him home, an' he's
kindly wilcome to the bist of our purvidin'."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis was certainly weak and unnerved, for
she fell back into her seat and began to sob.</p>

<p>"Whist, now, did ye think we mane to pisin yer
good man?" said Tim, cheerily.</p>

<p>"No, no, indeed; but I don't know what to make
of such kindness. It's nothing but cross words and
scowling looks I ever get."</p>

<p>Tim sat down with a determined air.</p>

<p>"Jist dhry yer eyes, me dear, and listhen to me;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
bekase I mane it all for yer good, and Jack's too,
poor bhoy!"</p>

<p>Tim continued: "Ye're both uv ye makin' a
therrible big misthake that'll ruin ye in time an'
etarnity. Here's Jack, a sheer lump uv misary, wid
no heart for wark nor play, an' here's yerself a frettin'
an' a pinin' yer life away; an' yer poor childer's like
to thread in yer stheps. An' here's mesilf an' me
wife, no betther an' no wurse off in the matther uv
brass nor ye, as happy an' comforthable as ye'd wish,
an' all bekase uv that same big misthake ye're
makin'."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Tim?" inquired Mrs. Jarvis,
wiping her eyes.</p>

<p>"Jack 'ud know what I mane, for he's had the lingth
uv me tongue many's the time on that same subjact;
but I'll till ye, an' maybe ye'll lay it to heart betther
nor he. Mrs. Jarvis, if ye'll belave me, it's the dhrink
that's at the botthom uv yer misary."</p>

<p>"I won't hear you say such dreadful things, Tim.
My Jack's no drinker, nor me neither. We're both of
us moderate, and never&mdash;never&mdash;" but here Mrs. Jarvis
faltered; and, eyeing her steadily, Tim went on:</p>

<p>"Ye niver, niver take a dhrop too much 'cept on
holiday times, an' sich like; an' thin, what wid the
boddher uv the childer, an' the sayte seein', an' the
heat, maybe ye git a little overcome wid what ye
take to quanch yer thirst."</p>

<p>"I dare say you're right, Tim," said Mrs. Jarvis,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
very much ashamed; "but I mean to say that my
Jack and me don't do what some folks do in the
way of drinking. He doesn't spend his evenings in
the public, except now and then; and, as for me, I
only take what will keep body and soul together,
though I confess you're pretty near the truth as to
taking more than is good on holidays."</p>

<p>"Well, we won't say anythin' about sich times. But
supposin' it's to-day, ye'll kape about till the childer's
home from school, an' the first thing'll be: 'Here,
Sammie, fetch me a pint of bitther,'&mdash;it's bitther,
I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I can't drink swill, there's no strength in it,"
said Mrs. Jarvis.</p>

<p>"Then you'll feel spry for a bit; but it don't last,
an' ye want to sit down an' take a nap afore the fire;
an' whin ye git up ye feel out uv sorts, an' the babby's
a burdhen, an' yer toddlin' Jim's a plague; an' by the
time that afthernoon school's done ye want windin'
up agin, an' ye must have half a pint afore ye touch
yer tay; an' whin Jack fetches the supper beer, ye're
more than riddy to take yer share. Thin ye slape
heavy like, an' if the babby <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'want's'">wants</ins> seein' to ye can
scarce wake; an' ye don't know how to dhrag yersilf
up in the mornin', an' ye wish ye'd got a dhrink uv
beer handy to give ye a sthart, on'y ye haven't the
face to sind for it afore breakfast; but, ye may belave
me, ye'll do that wan uv these days; an' the more ye
take uv the pisenin' stuff, the more ye'll want, an' the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
wurse ye'll feel, for there's no strength an' no good
in it at all, at all. It jist gives ye a little spurt for
the time, but it's over in a jiffy, an' ye're cross an'
fretful wid iverythin' an' iverybody, an' life's a burdhen
from morn till night. An' it's jist the same wid Jack,
poor bhoy. An' thin, whin ye might git a few hours
of plasure, ye're in an' out uv the public-houses till
ye're fair fuddled; an' the nixt day ye've both sore
heads and sour tempers, an' yer money's gone inter

<p>"Do you really think there's no good in the beer,
Tim? It does seem to put new life into one; and
I hanker after it when I'm weakly."</p>

<p>"Uv coorse, that's nateral, whin ye feel sthronger an'
betther afther a glass; but I've sthudied the quastion,
an' wiser heads nor mine'll tell ye jist as I do,&mdash;that
it takes out uv a bodhy more nor it iver puts in. It
gives ye for a space what ye want; but ye have to pay
for it at an awful rate uv intherest."</p>

<p>Mrs. Jarvis looked frightened; but Tim proceeded
in still graver tones:</p>

<p>"It's the mortal thruth as I'm tellin' ye, indade an'
indade; for ye have to pay for ivery bit uv go that
yer glass uv bitther gives ye wid yer ha'pence first,
uv coorse, an' afther wid loss uv yer good timper,
an' the time ye spind in pullin' yersilf togither agin.
Ye have to pay wid a wakely bodhy and a heavy
heart; so the childer's sint out uv yer sayte to git
inter mischif an' sin; and yer husban' niver sees yer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
face wid a smile on it, an' niver hears ye spake a
kindly word. An' sooner nor later ye'll find ye'll
have to pay for yer bitther wid the loss uv husban'
an' childer; for, ye may belave me, the time'll come,
bad cess to ye, whin Jack'll spind ivery blissid night
at the public, an' yer childer will make ye sup sorra
be rasin uv turnin' to bad ways; for there's no
worritin' wives at the public, an' no grumblin' mothers
round the sthreet corners. An' that's the last worrud
I can say, for the bell'll ring afore another minit."</p>

<p>With a nod to his wife, and a kindly "good
mornin'" to Mrs. Jarvis, Tim hastened away.</p>

<p>"My missis says I'm to fitch ye home to dinner
wid me, Jack, an' she's tould yer wife that same;
so come along wid ye, for ye'll git nought but air
for all ye're growlin' if ye stay there," were the words
that fell on John Jarvis's astonished ears, as he lay
watching his companion get into his coat at the
dinner hour.</p>

<p>"Well, I never, if that don't beat all," he exclaimed,
jumping up and seizing his own coat. "What's put
that into her head?"</p>

<p>"Case yer quastions an' look sharp now, for I want
ye to have a look round me bit uv ground afther
dinner," good-humouredly replied Tim.</p>

<p>The meal to which John presently sat down was
simple enough but abundant, and such as he seldom
partook of at his own table. He could not help
also contrasting the bright, happy faces of Tim's wife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and children with his own. He became silent and
absorbed in thought, as he walked round Tim's garden
when the repast was ended.</p>

<p>"Ye're an' illigant slip uv a pig, an'll make good
mate to ralish the bread an' praties nixt winter,
shure now, won't ye?" said Tim, addressing himself
to the bristly porker who grunted his approval of his
master's hand, as the two men leaned over the sty.</p>

<p>"I'd advase ye to kape a pig, Jack; ye've no idaya
how handy a bit uv bacon is through the winter, wid
so many mouths to be fadin'."</p>

<p>"You might just as well advise me to set up a
carriage and pair," answered John, somewhat testily.</p>

<p>"Nonsinse, ye might do it jist as aisy as mesilf."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know how you make that out, when
I never have a penny to bless myself with after I've
paid up on Saturday nights."</p>

<p>"Jist tell me how much ye an' yer ould woman
spind a week in beer," was the unexpected reply.</p>

<p>"At yer old game, matey, eh; well, really now,
I can't say. Perhaps I take three pints a day; not
much for a working man, Tim."</p>

<p>"An' maybe yer wife wad take a pint an' a half
uv bitther, that wad make sixpence a day for yersilf,
an' fourpence ha'pinny for hersilf; an' ye know ye
ofthen spind more nor that. That 'ud make six shillin'
an' a pinny three farthin's a wake; wan poun' six
shillin' an' eight pince a month; an' sixteen poun' a
year. How many pigs de ye sind down yer throats<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
at that rate in the coorse uv twelve months, me
bhoy?"</p>

<p>John Jarvis stood open-eyed and open-mouthed.</p>

<p>"Sixteen pound a year! What on earth have I
been a doin'? Sixteen pound a year; who'd have
thought it!" he ejaculated presently; and no more
could Tim get out of him, till, late in the afternoon
of that day, he emptied a hod of bricks at Tim's
feet with such energy that Tim looked up astonished.</p>

<p>"I've made up my mind, Tim, to have a pig. I've
been a fool, and thank'ee for as good as tellin' of
me;" and then, as if afraid to trust himself to say
more, he turned away to his work.</p>

<p>That night he and his wife, in the course of a
long conversation, not necessary to record here, made
certain resolves; two of which were never to spend
any money in beer, and to try and do their duty
better to each other and their children than they ever
had done.</p>

<p>In future years they never ceased to be thankful
for the promises then made, which, being faithfully
kept, bore fruit in a happy home, and the envied
worldly prosperity which was their neighbour's.</p>

<h2>THE MOTHER'S MISTAKE.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 72px;">
<img src="images/i026b-h.png" width="72" height="83" alt="H" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />ALF a dozen little children brimful of life
and frolic, a delicate wailing infant, an
indolent maid of all work, and a careworn
anxious mother, wearied with sleepless
nights and the burden of domestic cares!</div>

<p>"Poor thing! no wonder you look exhausted!"
said a friend who had called, and was listening with
a sympathetic ear to the story of a woman's fretting
cares and heavy responsibilities.</p>

<p>"I wouldn't mind if only my health were vigorous,
and I had physical strength to face life bravely,"
sighed Mrs. Stewart in reply.</p>

<p>"Do let me beg you to take all the care of
yourself that you can. You must think not only of
the present, but of the future, for these little ones
who need such unceasing toil now will want your
loving thought and oversight for many years to come;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and for their sake, and your husband's, it is your
bounden duty to stimulate your flagging energies and
strengthen your system to meet the constant demand
upon it," was the response.</p>

<p>"How can I?" despairingly asked Mrs. Stewart;
"you see baby, poor little fellow, fills my arms night
and day, and seldom gives me a chance of taking
proper rest."</p>

<p>"I know of only one way in which, overtaxed as
you are, you can prevent yourself from breaking down
under such pressure, and that is, by taking stimulants
in one form or another. When you feel nervous and
depressed, don't hesitate to take a glass of wine,
and before commencing your dinner and supper
take a little malt liquor to give you an appetite,
for after attending to the children's wants I am
sure you must feel disinclined to eat anything
yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, I am often unable to eat a mouthful of solid
food; but thanks for your advice; I will try what
a little stimulant will do for me."</p>

<p>So Mrs. Stewart commenced the daily use of
alcoholic stimulants, and finding their effects to be
beneficial to body and mind, and knowing little or
nothing of the subtle danger that lurked in the
poisoned cup, each domestic emergency that arose
was ere long met in the fictitious strength afforded by
the ready stimulant.</p>

<p>Years passed away, and the children, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
ceaseless demands upon their mother's patience and
love had well-nigh exhausted her strength, grew
into girlhood and boyhood.</p>

<p>One morning the family was seated at the breakfast
table when the servant brought in a letter
enclosing a bill with the familiar signature of a well-known
firm of brewers. The husband's brows knitted
as he glanced down the items.</p>

<p>"It seems to me, Eliza, that we use too much ale
and wine for a private family. Why, we consume
more and more, and I only take the same quantity
that I did years ago. It's more than I can stand!"
he said, looking across at his wife, who was listlessly
sitting at the head of the table with her coffee
untasted before her. She answered sharply:</p>

<p>"I can't help it, John; I shouldn't take it if I didn't
need it, and you might know that nothing else has
kept me alive for many a year."</p>

<p>"I don't complain of stimulant in moderation, my
dear; but I cannot believe that an extensive use of
alcohol can benefit a delicate constitution," replied
Mr. Stewart. His wife was not inclined to let the
matter drop.</p>

<p>"You seem to forget that the children take their
glass of ale too, and that makes some difference in
the amount we use."</p>

<p>"Well, I object to strong, healthy boys and girls
touching stimulants; it is expensive and quite
unneedful."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, papa, we like it so much; you mustn't stop
our supplies," cried several youthful voices.</p>

<p>"I must, and I will, my dears; you have not your
mother's plea of ill-health to urge, and from this
time I shall not expect you to take alcohol as a daily
beverage. I have no objection to lemonade or some
other non-intoxicant taking its place, for that will be
much less expensive, and besides, I have lately come
to the conclusion that young people, at least, are
likely to be harmed by the stimulus of ale or
wine."</p>

<p>"You are very absurd, John. What harm could
come to our boys and girls by taking half a glass of
ale at dinner and sometimes at supper?" testily asked
Mrs. Stewart.</p>

<p>"Why, Eliza, you know that a taste formed in
childhood is held with greater tenacity than any other,
and this taste for stimulant, which I am sorry to see
the children possess, may not always permit them to
remain satisfied with a glass or so daily; for, I was
reading not long ago, that the tendency of alcohol is
to create a morbid craving which may become that
insatiable thirst for drink which has ruined thousands
of men and women who were once children as
promising as those who sit round our table. I wish
I had been as wise years ago; they should never have
known the taste of it." So saying, Mr. Stewart left
the table.</p>

<p>A chorus of voices was raised as the door closed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's too bad!" "A great shame!" "Lemonade,
indeed!" and other exclamations were uttered
expressing disapproval of the father's action. Mrs.
Stewart had not been careful of late years to uphold
her husband's authority in the household, and the
unfilial remarks passed without rebuke, she merely
adding: "You'll have to mind what your father says,
you know, or we shall all get into trouble."</p>

<p>A few hours after, when the elder children were at
school, the youngest, a bright boy of seven, came to
her side and said: "Shall I get your wine, mamma?"</p>

<p>"You are mamma's dear boy to remember her
lunch time. Yes, bring it out, though it is quite early."</p>

<p>The wine was brought, and one glass, and then
another, and yet another was drained; the little fellow
meanwhile standing by. Catching sight of his wistful
looks, the mother said: "Come, and have a sip,
Bertie."</p>

<p>"Papa says I mustn't," faltered Bertie, but drawing
a step nearer. Lost to all sense of duty to husband
or child, Mrs. Stewart answered:</p>

<p>"Come, and drink, I tell you; didn't your father
say you were not to have any at dinner, and this
is lunch?"</p>

<p>She poured out a full glass, which the child drank
without further demur. He was shortly asleep on the
sofa, waking at dinner-time in fretful mood, and
turning impatiently from his food.</p>

<p>"I want my ale," he cried.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mustn't have it, Bertie," said his eldest sister;
"we all have to do without it now, thanks to papa's
whimsical notions."</p>

<p>"Wait till you're a man, Bertie, and you can drink
as much as you please, as I mean to," remarked his
fourteen-year-old brother with a contracted brow, and
a longing glance towards his mother's glass; while she,
poor deluded woman, looked on, languidly smiling,
with never a thought of the possible future of these
children for whom she had suffered and toiled. Many
a time, when scarcely conscious of her own actions, did
she encourage them to partake with her in secret of
that which was banished from the table. It was only
by the awful but timely discovery of their mother's
degradation that the children were prevented from
following in her steps.</p>

<p>A few months later, upon entering the house at the
close of the day, the father was met by his eldest
daughter, a girl of seventeen, who, with dismay on
her face, exclaimed: "Oh, papa, do come upstairs,
and see what is the matter with poor mamma. She
has been sleeping heavily for hours, and when I have
tried to disturb her, she has spoken quite wildly, and
then gone to sleep again. A dreadful thought has
just occurred to me that perhaps she has taken
poison." Mr. Stewart anxiously followed his daughter
to the room where his wife was lying on the bed. He
bent over her. Her unnatural appearance, and the
strong smell of liquor which proceeded from her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
parted lips, told the tale; and the truth, horrible and
ghastly, stood revealed to the husband.</p>

<p>"Papa, tell me the truth; is it poison?" asked his
daughter, as Mr. Stewart staggered to a seat. He
hesitated a moment, then hoarsely said:</p>

<p>"It is poison of the worst kind, my poor child!
Your mother is intoxicated. Oh, what shall we do?
How can we save her?" One brief moment of
horror, and then, subduing all outward manifestation
of her agony, the girl said:</p>

<p>"Papa, we must put the temptation out of her way.
We must all of us do without a luxury which has
brought about such a terrible result."</p>

<p>So from the house there was banished from that
time the alcoholic beverages which had been deemed
necessary; but, alas! too late to save the wife and
mother from rapidly drifting into confirmed habits of
drunkenness. All the schemes that love could devise
proved powerless to prevent the mistaken woman
from continued indulgence in the fatal cup.</p>

<p>The apparent need for constant recourse to
stimulants had long since passed away, but the habit
of past years had wrought deadly mischief, not alone
in gradually weakening the power of self-control, but
in creating that morbid craving for alcohol which
leaves its deluded victim no alternative but to obey
its behests. She had seen no harm in what had
become an essential of life to her, until she found
herself bound in its toils. True, she did not yield to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
its slavery without many a struggle, but temptation
was overpowering, and finally she succumbed to what
she declared was inevitable. She had forgotten the
only remedy available in such need as hers. No cry
from her despairing heart had risen to heaven; the
strength she lacked had not been sought from Him
Who only can save from the thraldom of sin, and
so, with the stain of uncancelled guilt upon her
conscience, she hastened to an untimely end.</p>

<p>As she lay dying with mind weakened by long
excess, they sought in vain for some sign of
penitence, for some words to assure their sad hearts
that the darkness of approaching dissolution was
gilded by hues of hope and trust in the forgiving
mercy of God through Christ. Day after day the
sufferer's lips were sealed in an obstinate silence that
struck dismay into the hearts of the watchers. She
was dying without hope it seemed; but the prayer of
faithful friends rose that the intercession of the
Great High Priest might be made, and prove effectual
for His wandering child.</p>

<p>Still the shadows deepened until it became evident
that the mother's hours were numbered.</p>

<p>"I will watch beside her now, my dears," said the
husband, dismissing his children for a brief period.
Taking his seat beside the motionless form, he sent
up a petition for help. Then, stooping over his wife,
he said: "Eliza, dear, would you not like me to pray
for you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The dying woman opened her eyes and faintly
whispered: "No."</p>

<p>"Shall I send for a minister to come and pray
with you, then, dear?"</p>

<p>Mrs. Stewart roused herself with a great effort, and
with energy exclaimed: "No, <i>He has prayed for me</i>,
and that is enough." They were her last words.
Before the next morning she had passed away, leaving
to husband and children the faint comfort of her
dying testimony: "He has prayed for me."</p>

<p>Say, gentle reader, whether being assured of the
thousand parallel cases which exist in this civilised
land of ours, you will dare to place temptation in
the way of your sister, by advocating the use of
alcohol as the necessary stimulant which alone can
nerve the failing heart and brain to meet the
exigencies of her daily life, thus placing before her
unwary feet the stumbling-block over which she may
fall never to rise? It may be that you who proffer the
well-meaning advice are moderate in the use of your
own alcoholic luxuries, and cannot understand the
mysterious attraction they may hold for another;
yet, surely to you is uttered the divine warning:
"Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that
puttest thy bottle to him." And you, sister, plying
your household tasks with an aching head, amidst the
ceaseless prattle of the little ones who call you mother,
striving patiently to perform your God-given duties,
yet fainting under the burden and heat of the day,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
beware, oh, beware, of seeking relief from the
tension of nerve and brain, which is a woman's
allotted portion, by deadening the finely strung
susceptibilities of your nature by indulgence in any
of the various forms which alcohol assumes, or
under which it would hide. Beware how you seek
its false stimulus to enable you to cope with
the almost superhuman duties devolving upon you!
Patience and strength to endure will be given in God's
appointed way; but be assured you will never find it
in that which is responsible for myriads of ruined
homes and blighted lives.</p>

<h2>THE CHILDREN'S SUPPER.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 82px;">
<img src="images/s-quote.png" width="82" height="83" alt="&quot;S" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />HE'S such a little thing, papa; really it
seems quite unnecessary to say anything
about it to her for the next few years."</div>

<p>"Perhaps you are right, dear. Elsie
will meet with no temptation at home, and a child
of her tender years is scarcely likely to find it
outside."</p>

<p>So said Mr. and Mrs. Morgan, when it had been
proposed to introduce the subject of total abstinence
to their youngest, a fairy child of six, and suggest to
her that she should follow the example of her parents
and brothers and sisters, who shortly before had
pledged themselves to abstain from the use of
intoxicating beverages.</p>

<p>"If we say anything to the dear child, it would be
necessary to tell her why we consider it advisable to
banish wine and ale from the house, and she would be
perplexed and saddened by the insight afforded into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
misery and degradation of which she, at present,
knows nothing. Her life is all sunshine now, and we
have no right to disturb her childish happiness,"
added Mrs. Morgan.</p>

<p>So Elsie's little mind puzzled over the unrevealed
reason of the absence from her father's table of the
bottled ales and sparkling wines, the taste of which
she had already learned to like.</p>

<p>A year passed away, and an invitation to a children's
party was sent to Elsie, who forthwith became wild
with excitement. A dainty creature she looked on
the afternoon of the important day. Her golden
curls softly floated over her blue merino dress, and
her brown eyes flashed and glowed with delight.</p>

<p>"Mother's darling, good-bye! try and be a little
lady, and nurse shall fetch you at nine o'clock," said
the mother, as she pressed her child's coral lips, and
then watched the little feet trip down the road beside
the servant.</p>

<p>The hours, brimful of frolic and merriment, passed
all too quickly for the happy children, and at eight
o'clock they gathered in the dining-room for the early
supper. The long table was covered with luxuries,
and beside each child's plate was a small glass of
wine.</p>

<p>"Now, dear children, make yourselves quite at
home, and ask for anything you want," said the
hostess, as her little guests took their places.</p>

<p>"May I have a glass of water, please?" asked an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
eight-year-old boy, soon after supper had commenced,
pushing his glass of wine aside.</p>

<p>"Oh, my dear Charlie, I am sure you will like a
glass of wine much better. Gentlemen always take
wine, you know," replied the lady.</p>

<p>"I mus'n't take wine, please, because I belong to the
Young Abstainers' Union," replied Charlie.</p>

<p>"Why, whatever kind of a Union is that, my boy?"
asked the host.</p>

<p>"It means that those who join it have promised
never to touch wine or anything of the kind."</p>

<p>"Stuff and nonsense! You'll never be a man
unless you can drink a glass of wine with your
friends."</p>

<p>Charlie coloured, but pushed his glass further away.</p>

<p>"Never mind, dear! our little friend's whims must
not be interfered with. He will learn better when he
is older," said the hostess, ordering a glass of water
to take the place of the wine.</p>

<p>Elsie sat next to Charlie, and turning to her the
host said:</p>

<p>"Now, Miss Elsie, you don't look as if you belonged
to this army of youthful abstainers. Let us see how
you can drink your wine; then you shall have the
glass that Charlie despises."</p>

<p>Nothing loth, Elsie obeyed. She had never been
allowed more than a sip or two from her father's
glass, and it was many months since even that
quantity had passed her lips. What wonder, then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
that when supper was ended, and she tried to leave
her seat, she should stumble and fall to the ground,
overcome by her unwonted indulgence in the stimulant.</p>

<p>"Poor little Elsie! let me help you up," cried
Charlie; but Elsie lay at his feet, and kicked and
screamed in unaccountable anger. When at last
she was picked up, her cheeks were purple with
passion, and her eyes gleamed with a strange, wild
light.</p>

<p>"The excitement has been too much for her, I
suppose; but I am quite surprised at such a display of
temper. She has always seemed so sweet and gentle,"
and the hostess hurried Elsie away to the waiting
nurse.</p>

<p>"Miss Elsie, Miss Elsie, I am ashamed of you;
whatever will your ma say?" expostulated the
servant, as Elsie clung to her skirts and refused to say
good-night.</p>

<p>"Papa, what is the matter with the child! I never
saw her look so strange," exclaimed Mrs. Morgan,
taking Elsie a few minutes later from her nurse's
arms.</p>

<p>Mr. Morgan sat the child on his knee, and as he
did so the fumes of wine met him.</p>

<p>"She has taken more wine than has been good
for her; that is what is the matter with our little
one!"</p>

<p>The horrified mother sank into a chair, but Elsie<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
raised her dimpled hand and struck at her father,
crying in a hoarse unnatural voice:</p>

<p>"I haven't, I haven't, you nasty papa! I didn't
have half enough of the nice wine."</p>

<p>"That is quite sufficient; take her away, nurse, and
put her to bed. I will talk to her to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We have made a great mistake, wife, and are
reaping the consequences in seeing our six-year-old
child inflamed with the stimulant which we have
banished from our own home," said the father, as the
door closed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Morgan wept, and made no reply.</p>

<p>Long and seriously did the parents talk to Elsie on
the following day, who, easily influenced, as what
child of her tender years might not be, listened with
tears to the revelation of unknown dangers, and
pleaded that she, like Charlie, might make such a
promise as would save her childish feet from again
being ensnared by the betrayer, and in the following
years prove her safeguard and defence.</p>

<p>Mothers, who read this true story, will you not
beware of the danger that threatens your little
children, and learn that none are too young and fair
to escape the toils of strong drink, unless guarded by
an intelligent knowledge of the perils that beset
them, and a resolve, early formed, never to touch or
handle the treacherous cup?</p>

<h2>ROLAND WEST'S MARK,</h2>

<h3>AND HOW HE MADE IT.</h3>

</div><div class='unindent'><br />ELL nurse to bring the children down,
Barnes," said Mrs. West, as a servant
answered a peal of the dining-room
bell.</div>

<p>"Yes, ma'am," replied Barnes, and in a few minutes
the children made their appearance. After being
introduced to a guest, the elder ones seated themselves
at the table, from which the dessert was not yet
removed.</p>

<p>"Please, mamma, may I have half a glass of
sherry?" asked one.</p>

<p>"I should like port better," said a second.</p>

<p>"Will you help them, very carefully, please, papa?"
asked the mother.</p>

<p>"I want some, too," said a bright, handsome boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
of five, upraising his sparkling eyes to his father's
face.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, Roland, you are such a wee boy; if you
have it, Leonard will want it."</p>

<p>"I do like it so much; let me have just a little
drop in papa's glass," teased Roland.</p>

<p>"Oh, come, mamma; that'll never hurt him; only
help to make a man of him, won't it, Roland?" said
his father.</p>

<p>"Yes, make me a man, like my papa! When I'm
big, I'll drink, oh, bottles and bottles; not have a
taste of papa's," said the child, looking contemptuously
at the remains of the sparkling wine, which, in his
father's glass, had been set before him.</p>

<p>"When you're a man, Roland, you will be a little
wiser than you are now," said his father, somewhat
sharply.</p>

<p>"I'll be as wise as&mdash;as&mdash;that man in the picture on
the library wall, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Who's that?" asked the guest, in amused tones.</p>

<p>"Why, Gladstone! The precocious youngster
strongly admires him, and is for ever declaring his
intention of copying his hero's plan of life."</p>

<p>"He has the brow and eye of a genius, West!"
said the visitor, gazing in admiration at the boy's face.
"I wish I had such a child! What are you going to
make of him?"</p>

<p>"I'll give him a good education, first; fit him for
the bar, if he takes kindly to the idea, and he ought,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
for he talks like a lawyer already. Yes, he'll make
his mark, I shouldn't wonder," replied the father,
with pride; "but what's the matter with the boy?
sleepy! at this time! Here, sit up! Mamma, his
forehead's burning. Lucy, has he had a fall
upstairs?"</p>

<p>"No, papa: but he was asleep when Barnes came
for us, and nurse had to wake him up to come
down."</p>

<p>Mr. and Mrs. West looked anxiously at the child,
who was already asleep, and after observing his
flushed cheeks and heavy breathing, Mrs. West sent
for the nurse.</p>

<p>"Nurse," she said, as the servant entered the room,
"have you noticed Master Roland seeming unwell
to-day?"</p>

<p>"No, ma'am, he was as bright as usual this
morning; but, when we were at dinner, I happened to
turn my head to attend to Miss Hetty, and Master
Roland emptied my glass of ale, and since then he
has been very drowsy, and I could scarcely rouse him
to bring him downstairs."</p>

<p>"Oh, nurse, I wish you would take your ale
some other time; if the children see you taking
it they are sure to want it, and I never allow
them to touch anything but a little wine," exclaimed
Mrs. West.</p>

<p>"Roland won't come to any harm, my dear, so don't
trouble yourself. Carry him away, nurse, and put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
him straight to bed. He'll be all right in the
morning," said Mr. West.</p>

<p>Nurse obeyed, looking much aggrieved. Bending
over the sleeping child she murmured: "What with
my ale and his father's drops, the boy's drunk. Poor
little fellow! he'll make his mark, as they're so fond
of saying, but I'm afraid it will be a very black one.
But I'll take no more blame to myself, for Master
Roland shall never see me touch my ale again; not
for missis's sake, though," added the girl with a dark
look.</p>

<p>Ten years went by, and again Mr. West entertained
the same friend at his well-spread table.</p>

<p>"What has become of that fine little fellow of
yours, West? Roland, I think you called him,"
inquired the guest, looking round the table and
missing from amongst the youthful faces the one that
had struck his fancy years ago.</p>

<p>"The young scamp's just finishing his schooldays,"
answered the father.</p>

<p>"He's been making his mark, I quite expect; no
one could help observing the boy had splendid capabilities.
Do you still think of making a lawyer of
him?" continued the visitor.</p>

<p>"I don't know what to do with him; I'm fairly
puzzled. It's true enough, as you say, he has
splendid capabilities, and might become anything he
chose; but he settles to nothing, and as for making
his mark at school, he's done it with a vengeance."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. West frowned from the bottom of the table,
but Mr. West took no notice, and continued:</p>

<p>"His education and his private bills have cost me a
pretty penny."</p>

<p>"Private bills! What has a school-boy to do with
private bills?" asked the guest.</p>

<p>"Oh, bills for champagne suppers and cigars, on the
sly, of course; the young rascal says the other
fellows do it, and he must, and I've had to pay the
piper. I told him last term he would have to stop
his extravagance and settle to hard work, but he
seems in no way inclined to do that, and I've had
more than one complaint of him from head-quarters."</p>

<p>"Well, papa, Roland's only a boy yet, and we
mustn't expect him to be as wise as his father,"
expostulated Mrs. West, in a tone of irritation.</p>

<p>"No, my dear, we must not and do not, but when I
was his age&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You were perfect, of course," finished Mrs. West;
"pray find some other topic of conversation than the
little weaknesses of your son."</p>

<p>"Little weaknesses!" Ah! thus had Roland's
grave faults and his early tendencies to evil courses
been glossed over by the false kindness of a fond
parent, until now, at the early age of sixteen, few
would have recognised in the boisterous stripling,
with swaggering gait and eyes already lustreless, the
once lovely boy, whose childish years had given the
fair promise of a golden future.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>Choosing for himself companions rife for mischief
and folly, on leaving school he indulged in those
pursuits, from which, though most congenial, he had
been greatly debarred during his seclusion. Now he
began, as he termed it, to enjoy life. Each evening
he sought the exciting scenes of revelry and debauch,
and neither his father's stern reproaches nor the
tearful pleadings of his mother, moved him to more
than a passing thought of the ruin which he was
inevitably working out for himself. But when his
constitution had become weakened by excesses, there
came into his life influences that were mighty in
their gentle drawing towards all that was good and
noble.</p>

<p>While yet a young man, he met, at the house of a
friend, a lady of strong religious tendencies. Strongly
drawn to her by the attraction of a well-balanced
mind and a beautiful exterior, he resolved, if possible,
to win her affections. So great was her influence
upon him, that, for a time, the force of evil habits lost
its power, and other society was readily relinquished
for hers, and the house of God beheld him an
outwardly reverent worshipper at her side. Alas!
that one so influenced by the power of human love
should have missed those gracious impressions which,
made on the tender heart of childhood, so often
prove the good seed of the Kingdom, springing up
into life eternal.</p>

<p>In thus taking upon himself the profession of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Christianity, Roland was no hypocrite. He had seen
the beauty and acknowledged the power of a life that
was far above him, and from his heart he loathed the
life he had hitherto led, and earnestly desired to put
it away for ever. But strong only in his own strength,
and looking to no higher power than earthly love to
aid him in his upward course, what marvel that he
deceived himself and others also. With his heart's
desire at length accomplished, and with renewed
prospects of a bright future, Roland West might have
retrieved the dark past, and entered upon a career of
usefulness, such as had been fondly pictured for him.
Was it so? Let one scene, after a lapse of twelve
years, tell its sorrowful tale.</p>

<p>In a cottage in one of the crowded suburbs
of London, a pale, anxious-looking mother was
alternately sewing and directing the studies of
a fine boy, with a massive forehead and intelligent
eyes.</p>

<p>"Mother, I've mastered it at last; I'm so glad," he
said presently.</p>

<p>"That's right, my son; you are quick, like your
father," his mother replied with a sigh.</p>

<p>"My father quick!" said the boy with ill-repressed
contempt; "I didn't know that before."</p>

<p>"Hush, Allan, your father was very clever
when I first knew him, and could do anything he
liked."</p>

<p>"Then why does he leave you to work so hard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
now, while he lounges about all day? Mother,
I must speak; tell me that!" cried the boy
impetuously.</p>

<p>"I cannot have you speak of your father like that,
Allan; but I will tell you why he cannot now do
what he ought. When he was a boy like you he was
allowed to choose his own way in everything, and
have all that he asked for, and he chose wrong
companions and sinful pleasures until he ruined and
blighted his own life and others too."</p>

<p>Allan hung his head, and remembered how he had
sometimes rebelled against the wise decisions of his
much loved mother, and determined that in the future
he would add as little as possible to the heavy
burden that rested upon her frail shoulders. There
was a step outside, and Mrs. West rose hurriedly
saying: "Clear your books away, and go to bed,
Allan; I must lay supper;" but before Allan had
time to obey, his father entered.</p>

<p>Was it possible that in a few short years Roland
West should have become the besotted, degraded-looking
man, who flung himself into the one easy-chair
the room possessed?</p>

<p>"That boy up yet," he said with a scowl, "at those
everlasting books; let him go to work like other
boys of his age, and earn his salt."</p>

<p>"That's what I intend him to do as soon as he is fit,
Roland," answered his wife in the quiet, firm tone with
which she always addressed her husband; usually he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
outwardly submitted to the controlling power that
her voice and eye exerted upon him; but this night
he was in no mood to be controlled or reasoned
with.</p>

<p>"Hold your tongue, you saucy jade! What right
have you to be bringing up my boy to know more
than his father, and teaching him your own fine airs
and graces. I'll have no more of it. Here, boy, fetch
me a pint of ale!"</p>

<p>"Roland," said his wife, "Allan shall not go into
that place of cursing and drunkenness; I'll go myself
rather."</p>

<p>"Oh," said the man, inwardly quailing before her
flashing eyes, "is that it, my high and mighty dame?
either you or Allan shall go, then."</p>

<p>Seizing a jug, in a moment his wife had disappeared,
returning shortly with her face crimson, and the
foaming vessel in her hand.</p>

<p>"Well, madam, you've had your way, now I'll have
mine," said her husband, and filling a glass, he called
his son downstairs. "Here, Allan," he said, "drain
that, or I'll thrash you soundly."</p>

<p>"Father, you forget, I belong to the Band of Hope,"
said the boy appealingly.</p>

<p>"Drink it, I say," and the infuriated man seized the
child's arm.</p>

<p>"Roland, will you blight your boy's life as you
have your own?" interposed the mother. Down
came the cruel hand on wife and child, and, while a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
volley of oaths rained from the man's lips, Allan
lifted the glass and drained the contents.</p>

<p>"Now, go to bed, and remember that when your
father speaks you are to obey. I'll make a man of
you yet, you young milksop!"</p>

<p>Sobbing bitterly, Allan crept to his bed, and his
anguish found vent in the pitiful question: "What
else can I be but a drunkard when my father makes
me drink?"</p>

<p>What, indeed, could be the future of the child, who
from that time was compelled to fetch, and then
partake of his brutal father's cup? What marvel that
with early acquired taste for strong drink, he impatiently
cast aside the restraint of a tender mother,
and followed with rapid footsteps his father to a
premature dishonoured end!</p>

<p>Another scene, the closing one, and all that is
needful for reproof and warning will have been drawn
from the life-history of Roland West.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"He's worse to-day, mum," said the nurse of a
workhouse infirmary to a woman closely veiled, who
was bending over a bed upon which lay stretched the
form of an old man. What a face for any woman to
gaze upon, and know that once it had been the joy of
her life to mark the light of intellect and the tenderness
of devotion sparkling and kindling in the eyes
that now only turned in their sunken sockets with
dim, vague unrest from side to side<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>.</p>

<p>"Do you know me, Roland?" asked the visitor; but
no reply was made, nor sign of any kind given.</p>

<p>"Bless you, no, mum; he doesn't know me as allus
feeds him, and hasn't for months. He jest lays there
and rolls his eyes about, and cries sometimes like
a babby," said the nurse who stood by. "You see,
mum," she continued, "it's more often like this with
them as drinks, when they can't get at their drops,
they jest get lower and lower, and you can't do
nothing for them. My old man went off like this
one, and he'd been a frightful drinker."</p>

<p>"How do you know when he's worse?" asked
Mrs. West, for it was she.</p>

<p>"He won't swaller his food, mum, and you can't
get no heat into him; jest feel his hands." Mrs. West
took the icy hand into her own, and started at its chill
dampness.</p>

<p>"This is no ordinary coldness," she said, with
a nurse's quick perception; for many years had passed
since, obeying her husband's mandate, she had found
occupation for herself, and food for her children, at
the bedside of the sick and dying.</p>

<p>"He is dying," she said, touching the clammy
forehead; "Oh, Roland, say one word to your wife
before you go." As if in answer to her appeal there
flashed a gleam of intelligence from the glazing eyes,
and with a tremendous effort one word broke from
the blue lips with terrible distinctness, and rang
through the ward. It was the word "Forgive."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Then the eyes grew fixed, and the face slowly settled
down into the stillness of death. He who was once
the pride of a fond father, and the joy of a doting
mother, had made his mark and gone from a workhouse
bed to answer before his Creator and Judge
for the deeds done in the body.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br />ELL, my girl, this is a spanking place to
call our own," said Richard Watson, as
he surveyed with pride the two tiny
rooms which formed the new home to
which he had just brought the woman of his choice.
His mother had left them together, after putting the
last remaining touches to the place; and they had
completed their short tour of investigation, discovering,
at each step of their slow progress, some new trace
of the thoughtful care that had been bestowed
upon the arrangement of the goods and chattels
with which the two young people had ventured to
set up housekeeping.</div>

<p>Richard was a mason by trade, and although his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
wages were not high, they had enabled him to save
something towards a rainy day, and to furnish the
aforesaid rooms.</p>

<p>Jane, his wife, had been a domestic servant in a
clergyman's family for many years, and had left, with
mutual regrets, when Richard would no longer wait
for the fulfilment of her promise to him. There was
only one fault that her mistress ever had occasion
to find with Jane; and, before her maid left, she very
faithfully pointed it out; showing her that continued
yielding to her failure would be likely to prove
disastrous to her happiness as a wife. Jane listened
attentively, and promised to remember the warning,
and guard against what she knew to be her greatest
besetment. And she fully intended to keep her
promise. Richard had been so patient and good,
and was so fond of her, that it would, indeed, be a
shame if she did not do all in her power to make
him happy. So strong was she in her own purpose,
that she forgot that the habit which had grown with
her years would be too powerful for merely a good
resolution to overcome.</p>

<p>But that evening, as they lingered over their
meal, there was no suspicion of future trouble. The
atmosphere was one of love and calm enjoyment.
Would that upon every married life there always
rested the warm sunshine of that mutual love and
trust with which most young people commence their
journey together. Too often the love grows cold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
faith in each other is lost, and the only change that
comes to many from the sore misery of living divided
lives is the darkness of death, and an unknown,
unprepared for, eternity.</p>

<p>"O, Richard, I never thought you'd have had
everything so nice and ready for me. I quite
expected plenty of work for a few days," said Jane.</p>

<p>"'Twasn't likely, my dear, as I'd have brought you
to that at first, I'd sooner have paid a woman; but
mother, she'd have been quite hurt if I hadn't have let
her set to work; and I'm sure not even you would
have made the place look prettier and brighter,"
replied Richard.</p>

<p>"No, you're right, Richard. Dear old soul! It's
very likely that I shouldn't have fixed the rooms
half so nicely; but I shall do my very best to keep
them just as they are for many a day. Missis always
said I was careless about my work; but it seems to
me as if doing for one's own home must be a very
different thing to slaving for any one else."</p>

<p>"I've no fear of you, my dear, none at all," replied
Richard; "but I don't want you to be slaving and
toiling away all your time. You'll get plenty of that
by and bye, like my poor mother."</p>

<p>"I can do all my own work, and perhaps lend her
a helping hand, for she'll be sure to miss you; and
'tisn't fair that I should take her son, and not make
her some kind of a return."</p>

<p>"Bless you, my girl! I'd thought of that before,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
but didn't like to say anything to you about it, because
some women might have been jealous if their husbands
had thought anything about their old mothers, who
nursed 'em and brought 'em up. I'm real glad you're
not that sort."</p>

<p>"I should think it downright mean to be jealous
of my own mother-in-law, so you never need fear for
me, my dear," returned Jane.</p>

<p>Thus they chatted on through the evening, the first
of many such pleasant times; and for weeks Richard
never returned from his daily toil without being
gladdened by the sight of a figure in clean print dress
standing in the doorway to greet him.</p>

<p>But one evening, although Jane met her husband
as usual, there was something about her which puzzled
Richard.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, missis?" he inquired
at length, examining her critically, as she took her
seat opposite him at the table and began to pour out
his tea.</p>

<p>Jane flushed and hesitated, and finally said: "What
eyes you men have! Can't you see?"</p>

<p>"I declare you've never changed your morning
gown, and it wasn't extra clean to start with; so
said I to myself this morning: 'I suppose Jane's
going to have a cleaning day; but there's one comfort,
she'll be as neat and clean when I get back as she
was the first day she stepped foot in the house.'"</p>

<p>"That's just how it is, Richard. I've had a good<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
hard day's work; and I was so tired, I thought for
once it didn't matter about changing my dress, as my
hands and face were clean."</p>

<p>"Humph," said Richard. He was evidently not
quite of his wife's opinion; and, all that evening,
whenever he happened to look across at Jane, he
experienced a disagreeable sensation at the unaccustomed
sight of a dirty dress, and hair that was anything
but smooth.</p>

<p>Richard was certainly very particular; and the
next morning, on returning from closing the street
door behind him, after listening to his last charge
to meet him that evening in her usual spotless attire,
Jane uttered the ejaculation: "Fussy!"</p>

<p>At that juncture, her landlady, Mrs. Jones, stepped
in, asking for the loan of some kitchen utensil, and
Jane, with little work on hand, fell into gossip.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said, in answer to her neighbour's
comments on the appearance of the room, "it does
look nice. I spent the best part of yesterday over it.
My good man is very particular, and so am I, for the
matter of that, and I like a clean place to sit in."</p>

<p>"Ah, well, wait till you've a batch of children, like
me, and you won't be able to have your regular
cleaning times, and get done to sit with your husband
of evenings. Not that mine's ever at home, if I had
the chance of sitting down a spell," said Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p>"My husband always stays at home, and I should
fret if he took to leaving me alone," replied Jane.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't you make too much fuss over him at first,
my dear. He'll be spoiled, and always expect you
to keep it up. Just you take my advice, Mrs. Watson,
and live a little easy the next few months, while
you've got the chance. Life'll be hard enough for
you, depend upon it; and I'd just save my strength
if I was you, for you'll need it all."</p>

<p>With these parting words the woman went away,
leaving her suggestions and advice to work as they
might in Jane's mind. It was so different to anything
her husband's mother had ever said to her on
the matter. "Spare no pains," she had said, "during
the first year of your married life, to make home the
happiest place in all the world for your husband, and
you will never regret it."</p>

<p>Hitherto Jane had listened to her words and acted
upon them, thereby securing her own and her husband's
happiness. Now she sat down, somewhat listlessly,
to think over what Mrs. Jones had just said.</p>

<p>"Who's likely to be right, I wonder, mother or
Mrs. Jones? 'Tisn't likely that his own mother would
think her son could be spoiled; and yet, I don't
know but what I'm doing that, and I'm sure I can't
keep it up always. I never have an idle moment,"
mused she; "what with keeping my own place as
clean as a new pin, and running round to mother's.
I wonder what Mrs. Jones would have said if I'd
told her that he didn't like my dirty dress yesterday
evening, and scarcely said a word to me, after slaving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
all day to please him! Men do want a lot from
a woman, I must say!"</p>

<p>But just at that point Jane started to her feet,
and resolutely put away the new thought which had
come upon her quite unawares. But Jane's habit
had asserted itself again, and, little by little, she
yielded to it; until one day Richard let himself into
his home with the latch-key, and, walking into the
little kitchen, found an untidy place, and a dirty wife
stooping before a fireless grate.</p>

<p>"Come, come, missis, do you know the time?"
he said.</p>

<p>"How should I, when the clock's stopped?"</p>

<p>"Why didn't you wind it then, my dear? But
don't flurry yourself," he added kindly; "I'll get
cleaned, and then maybe tea'll be ready." And
passing into the outer kitchen, Richard began to
wash away the traces of his day's work. Half
ashamed of herself, Jane bustled about, and soon had
tea waiting. When Richard came in he glanced at
his slatternly-looking wife, and said: "I don't mind
waiting while you're making yourself tidy, Jane."</p>

<p>"It doesn't matter, Richard. We're late to-night,
and the evening will be gone directly."</p>

<p>"Well, Jane, I don't like my wife to sit down in
such a dirty state as you're in. I don't see the need
of it, when I can be clean enough."</p>

<p>"Oh, no! I dare say not; you men think we women
folk can do the dirtiest work and never soil our fingers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
and be always ready to dance attendance on you
whenever you choose to come home," said Jane, using
her perverse woman's tongue as she had never before
ventured to do in her husband's presence.</p>

<p>Richard opened his lips to utter a sharp retort, but,
being a man of peace, thought better of it; and,
rising from his seat, took down his hat from its peg,
remarking that there was one woman at least who he
knew would be very glad to dance attendance upon
him, and as he thought he had rather neglected her
of late, he would go and spend the evening with her.
The moment he had gone, Jane rushed into the street,
calling: "Come back, Richard, do come back!" but
Richard had gone too far to hear, or did not choose
to heed her cry.</p>

<p>"He's never left me before," she cried, as she
returned to her desolate room; and conscience, with
many a sting, told her that it was all her own
doing.</p>

<p>Richard rapidly made his way to his mother's
cottage; but when he reached it, all was darkness, and
there was no answer to his repeated knocks. "Out
nursing again, I suppose," he muttered, and not
knowing whither to turn his steps for the evening, for
he was determined not to return home till late, he
stood hesitating.</p>

<p>"Well, Dick, my boy, what brings you away from
your home and your wife to-night? It's a strange
thing to clap eyes on you these days," said a voice at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
his side; and turning, he saw a man with whom he
had formerly worked.</p>

<p>"You're right; I don't often turn out of nights;
but I wanted to see my mother, and I find she's out."</p>

<p>"The very ticket! your wife won't be expecting
you back just yet; and we want a sociable, sensible
fellow like you at our workmen's club. You've
promised me many a time to come and see us; now's
your chance!" said the man, clapping him on the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"I don't care if I do look in," said Richard after
a moment's deliberation; "but I mustn't be late."</p>

<p>"Come along, then," answered the man, well
pleased with the chance of introducing a manly
fellow like Richard to his companions in the
neighbouring tavern, where the meetings of the club
were nightly held. Suffice it to say, that late that
evening Richard was helped to the door of his home
by some of its members, with the understanding that
he was to be enrolled among their number on the
following evening. It would take too long to
picture Jane's distress when she met him after
her long waiting and remorse. Her husband in such
a condition, and none to blame but herself! She did
not sleep that night, and in those dark hours she
determined that the past should be retrieved. She
watched him anxiously the next morning, but he
never spoke, except to answer her questions in
monosyllables. Long before his time for returning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
from work had arrived, the kitchen was spotlessly
clean, the kettle singing on the shining grate, and
Jane herself arrayed in a clean gown and new
ribbon.</p>

<p>"Surely, he'll want to stay at home to-night, when
he sees how pleasant everything looks again," said she
to herself. When he came in, he took no apparent
heed of his surroundings, but drank his tea in moody
silence. When he had finished, he rose and took his
hat, but Jane started up, crying:</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, pray don't leave me again to-night!
See how nice everything is, and I promise you it shall
always be so."</p>

<p>"Don't take on so, lass," he said, touched by the
sight of her tears; "I won't be long away, but I've
made a promise, and must stick to it," and with that
Jane had to be content. But though she watched
until she grew weary he came not to cheer her
loneliness. She had carelessly permitted him to leave
her side, and now other influences were around him, and
she must reap the consequences of her folly. From
that time Jane's evenings were spent in solitude and
tears. In vain she sought to keep her husband under
the safe shelter of his own roof. When he would
have yielded to her entreaties, his companions came
and carried him away in triumph. Eventually, Jane
grew resentful and careless, and when her first little
one was born she had settled down to habitual
neglect of her home and her own person. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
responsibility of motherhood roused her to fresh
efforts, which, if she had persevered in them, might
have proved successful, but she soon relapsed into her
slatternly ways, and was content to spend her days
listlessly nursing her baby, and musing upon the
wretchedness of her lot. At first Richard had taken
considerable pride in the tiny atom of humanity
which had found its way into the home; but baby
came in for her share of neglect, and after a while
her father took little notice of her.</p>

<p>"Poor little baby! your father doesn't care for
you or me! He loves the drink and his public-house
mates a deal better than the pair of us," sighed Jane
many a time. Well, Jane, who sent him to the public-house
to find friends and amusements, in the first
place? You have no one to thank but yourself you
know, or you might know, if you would care to think.
But Jane seldom did think, and the gulf in the
cottage home between husband and wife grew wider
and deeper as the months and years rolled away.
Children were born to their lot of misery and neglect,
and Jane had hard work to fill their hungry mouths
and cover their nakedness. Pitifully small grew the
weekly sum which Richard brought home to meet
the growing need of those who belonged to him.
How else could it be when so large a portion of his
hard-earned money went to support the wife and
children of the thriving publican whose house Richard
patronised every evening of the week?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know how you expect me to get bread
and pay rent with that pittance," said Jane one
Saturday evening as he threw a few shillings into
her lap.</p>

<p>"If it isn't enough, why don't you go out, then, and
earn for yourself, like many a better woman than you
is doing?" he growled.</p>

<p>How low Richard had sunk! But he had only
gone down one step at a time.</p>

<p>"And who'd look after your children, I'd like to
know, while their mother's away slaving?" retorted
his wife.</p>

<p>"Precious little looking after such dirty brats
want. Something to eat once or twice a day,
and mud to make pies of, and they're enough like
their dirty mother to be satisfied," said Richard,
scowling in disgust at his miserable-looking wife,
who replied:</p>

<p>"I'm a good match for you, whatever you may say,
although I should be sorry to have your red nose and
bleared eyes." Richard muttered an oath, and his
wife disappeared, having gone as far as she deemed
prudent.</p>

<p>"I've a good mind to go out cleaning after all.
It's a new idea. I can't sit in the house, and fold
my arms in idleness while the children want bread,"
said Jane to herself that evening. "It's true enough
that the children don't want much looking after.
I dare say Mrs. Jones would take baby and give the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
others their food for a few pence, if I could get
work."</p>

<p>"I declare I'll do it!" she presently decided.</p>

<p>There was little difficulty in getting work, and for
her children's sake Jane worked as she had never
done before. With the continual strain on body and
mind she grew prematurely old and worn; but there
was no help for it. She must work now until all
strength failed, for Richard's money ceased altogether,
and the children were wholly dependent upon her
exertions.</p>

<p>One day she went to a new place to which she had
been recommended by one of her constant employers.
Whilst she was cleaning a window in the room where
the mistress of the house was seated at work, the lady
commenced a conversation. Usually reticent about
her own affairs, Mrs. Martyn's gentleness touched
Jane's desolate spirit, and the story of her wretchedness
was soon told.</p>

<p>"Were you happy when you were first married?"
Mrs. Martyn inquired, and was startled by the
vehement answer:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, ma'am, as happy as the day was long!
My husband was so good, and always spent his
evenings at home. Ah, we were happy!"</p>

<p>"What made the difference, my poor woman?"
was the next question, and Jane hung her head. She
had long ceased to blame herself for her share in the
wrong which had blighted her life. It all came back<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to her now; conscience spoke, and would not be
silenced, and told her that but for her wrong-doing,
hers might still have been a happy home.</p>

<p>"It was my fault, ma'am," she faltered. "I was
careless and neglectful of his comforts, and spoke
sharply to him for no earthly reason, and he's that
changed, I don't know him, and he gets worse. Look
here, ma'am," and opening her dress she revealed
a bruise, inflicted by a cruel hand, "that's the first
time he's ever given me a real blow; but he'll not
stop at that."</p>

<p>"Poor thing," said Mrs. Martyn, shuddering at the
revelation of a sister's woe.</p>

<p>"Couldn't you try and win him back?"</p>

<p>"I tried years ago, and it was no use, and now he
isn't worth it, ma'am," answered Jane.</p>

<p>"But suppose he could be drawn from his evil
companions, and strong drink! Don't you think it
would be worth while to have an affectionate father
for your children, and a tender husband for yourself,
Mrs. Watson?"</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, if it could be done; but I don't
believe it could," replied Jane, despondingly.</p>

<p>"Will you promise me to make one more effort if
I help you, and ask Mr. Martyn to look after your
husband? He wouldn't be the first man whom my
husband has helped out of the mire."</p>

<p>A flash of hope lit up Jane's face, and she said:
"You're very kind to take any interest in a stranger,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
ma'am, I'm sure, and if it will please you, I'll try
once more."</p>

<p>"That's right; now go on with your work as
quickly as possible, and I'll do my best to arrange
some plan for you."</p>

<p>Jane's fingers fled over her work, as she looked into
a possible future of brightness for herself and her
children. "Hoping against hope," she called it, and
yet she continued to hope.</p>

<p>At four o'clock that afternoon, Mrs. Martyn came
to her and bade her lay aside her work, and prepare
to go home.</p>

<p>"Never mind finishing, Mrs. Watson; the servant
can manage very well now, and it is of the utmost
importance that you should be home early to carry
out my plan," said the lady. "Your husband comes
home, you tell me, soon after six for his tea. Now
you must have your kitchen as neat and clean as you
can get it in the time. The fire must be bright, and
the tea laid, and everything as much like it used to
be as possible. In this parcel you will find a little
good tea, and a chop for your husband, also a few
other things which you may find useful. You may
take the old carpeting you shook to-day; it will do
to lay down before your fire-place. But, above all,
you must be perfectly clean and fresh yourself, your
best dress on, and a bright ribbon, if you have it, and
your children to match. Don't forget anything, and
Mr. Martyn will look in during the evening and see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
if he cannot persuade your husband to come with
him to the Gospel Temperance Room and sign the
pledge. Remember, I shall be asking God to bless
your effort, and I believe He will."</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am," cried Jane, with streaming eyes,
"how can I ever thank you for your goodness?"</p>

<p>"Don't wait to try, but run off, or you will not
have time to prepare for your husband's return."</p>

<p>With hurried footsteps Jane sped home. Arrived
there, she begged Mrs. Jones to keep her baby until
she was ready for her, while the other little ones were
dismissed into the back yard. It was years since the
grate had received such a polishing, or the floor such
a scrubbing. When it was finished, Jane surveyed
the work of her hands with satisfaction. "Now for
myself," she said. Opening the bag Mrs. Martyn had
given her, she discovered a white apron, two or three
clean pinafores for the children, besides the things
Mrs. Martyn had specified.</p>

<p>"I'll put on one of those print dresses I used to
wear. It's faded and old-fashioned now; but it's
clean, and that's more than the rags I've got are, and
maybe Richard'll think I look something like I did
years ago," said Jane; and, although there were lines
of care on her forehead, and hollows in her cheeks,
there was such an unwonted sparkle in her eyes as
she tried the effect, that she scarcely recognised
herself as the same forlorn-looking creature who had
left the house that morning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come, children, I want you." Three ragged,
unkempt little ones came running in.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, what a nice fire!" "Oh, mother,
what a lovely cake!" and "Oh, mother, how grand you
look, and what a clean floor you've made!" were the
exclamations that burst from the astonished trio, as
they entered the room.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's a clean floor, and you must try to keep
it so; and if you're good you'll get some cake when
father comes home. Listen, children! perhaps if
you're very quiet and behave yourselves, father'll
stay at home to-night and every night, and then
I needn't go out to work any more, and leave you
alone all day long."</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, that would be jolly!" they cried.</p>

<p>Jane had scarcely imagined what a little attention
would do for her neglected children, and she exulted
in the thought that their father would scarcely know
them. Baby's turn came last of all; and finally Jane
sat down, with all preparations made, in no little
trepidation, to await her husband's arrival. His heavy
step was heard at last, and she rose as he entered the
room, while her children clustered round her.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, missis," stammered Richard, after a
moment's stupified pause; "I've made a mistake
somehow."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, Richard, you've made no mistake!
This is your home, I am your wife, and these are
your children."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jane," he exclaimed, "what's come to you all?
who's coming, and what's this cleaning up for?"</p>

<p>"Richard, my dear, there's no one but you coming,
and this cleaning up is all for you; and if you'll only
make up your mind to stay at home always, you'll
never find any worse place to come to; but a great
deal better in time, I promise you faithfully," and
Jane sank down in her chair, unable to stand any
longer.</p>

<p>"Well, my girl, I will say as it's the pleasantest
sight I've set eyes on for many a long day. Put the
baby down, and let's look at you again. I declare
you look like the Jane I brought home years ago.
I thought I'd lost her for good, I did; but here she is
again," and he put his hands upon her shoulders and
kissed her; the first kiss that his lips had left upon
hers for years, and Jane melted into floods of tears.</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard," she said, laying her head upon his
breast, "if you'll only forgive me and love me again,
I'll make up for the past by being the best wife that
ever a man had!"</p>

<p>"Nay, my dear, you've got no call to talk like that.
I've been a wretched husband, and a bad father, and
it's me as needs to ask forgiveness. Don't cry, lass,
now don't, it hurts me," and Jane restrained her tears
as quickly as possible, and with womanly tact seated
the baby on his knee, and sent the other children to
crowd round him while she made the tea; so that
when they took their places at the table the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
strangeness of the scene had well-nigh disappeared.
The children partook freely of the good things which
Mrs. Martyn's care had provided; but Richard and Jane
found it hard work to touch anything, for the tide of
recollections that swept across them and threatened
at times to destroy their outward composure. After
tea Jane anxiously watched her husband's movements,
and in terror saw him rise from his seat.</p>

<p>"You're not going out, Richard?" she pleaded.</p>

<p>"Nay, lass, don't be afraid," he said, kindly, "I'm
only going to wash, and make myself fit for the clean
place and the clean wife."</p>

<p>Overjoyed, Jane bustled about, and quickly put
the children to bed; and when Richard entered the
kitchen again, she was sitting with needle in hand
and a pile of ragged garments by her side.</p>

<p>"This looks like old times, Jane," he said.</p>

<p>"It's my fault that there's ever been any change,
Richard," she answered, humbly; "but if you'll only
help me, we'll have our happy home back again."</p>

<p>"I don't know what to say, Jane, to always staying
at home with you. You see, there's the club, and I'm
almost bound to attend the meetings sometimes, and
they're held in the 'Green Dragon,' and when once a
fellow's there, he can't get away in a hurry."</p>

<p>"Oh, Richard, let the club go. It'll never do you
any good, and unless you break away altogether, it'll
be the ruin of you."</p>

<p>Richard looked thoughtful, but said nothing.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>Just then there was a knock at the door, and he
started up, saying:</p>

<p>"That's some of my mates. I'll send them off
to-night, Jane, anyhow."</p>

<p>"Oh, that it may be the kind gentleman who has
promised to come!" thought Jane.</p>

<p>It proved to be Mr. Martyn, and Richard waited
with the door in his hand, in doubt as to the stranger's
errand.</p>

<p>"Are you Mr. Watson?" asked the gentleman.
It was so long since Richard had heard himself
addressed in such a manner, that at first it did not
strike him that he was the man who bore that
name.</p>

<p>"That's me, sir. Will you come in?"</p>

<p>Mr. Martyn walked into the kitchen, glanced round
in pleased surprise, and took the chair that Jane
proffered.</p>

<p>"Now, Mr. Watson, I have only heard of you this
afternoon, but I believe you're just the man we
want."</p>

<p>"Glad to help you in any way I can, sir," answered
Richard, in much surprise.</p>

<p>"Well, we have taken a hall down the road, here,
and we want to fill it with working-men whose
evenings are free; make it a comfortable, homely
place, you know, with books, and papers, and harmless
amusements, and an occasional lecture or address,
with, perhaps, a little speechifying among the men,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
as some of them know how to talk sensibly. We
only commenced last week, but we are getting on
nicely, and intend, on Sunday evenings, holding a
lively service, with plenty of singing. Will you join
us?" asked Mr. Martyn.</p>

<p>"I should like to, sir; but don't talk of me being
the one to help you, for I want helping myself.
Perhaps you don't know; but I've been going down,
down, these six years and more, and I'm fairly sick when
I think what a fool I've made of myself," said
Richard, with drooping head.</p>

<p>"Come, my friend," answered Mr. Martyn, with his
hand on Richard's shoulder: "that's the first step
towards becoming a wiser man. The second is, to
make up your mind that the past shall be retrieved
as far as that is possible, and that for your wife and
children's sake you'll turn over a new leaf."</p>

<p>"It's easy to talk, sir, excuse me; but you don't
know what that means for a poor man like me," said
Richard.</p>

<p>"I do know something about it," replied Mr.
Martyn; "it means, every day, facing, like a man, the
taunts and jeers of your fellow-workmen. It means
fighting with all the power you have left, and all the
power that God can give you, against the terrible
cravings of the appetite for strong drink which you
have created for yourself. It means giving up any
pleasure which you have found in the excitement of
the tap-room, and the company of your so-called<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
friends. But let me tell you what else it means. It
means holding up your head, like a being created in
God's image, as you go through life. It means
retaining the love of your wife and children, and once
more rejoicing in home comforts and fireside joys;
and, above all, it means putting away from you the
greatest and most effectual hindrance to your walking
in the narrow way, which leads to the heavenly
home and eternal life, in the presence of God."</p>

<p>Richard was much stirred by Mr. Martyn's words.
He buried his head in his hands, and when he looked
up again, there were traces of deep emotion on his
face.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said, "I thank you from my heart; it's
all true, and a deal more than you've said, but I never
heard it put so plain before. I've a mind to come
round to your place to-night; leastways, if my poor
wife'll spare me," added Richard, with unaccustomed
consideration.</p>

<p>"I shall be delighted, Richard, if you'll go; and
thank you, a thousand times, for your kindness, sir,"
said Jane, her face beaming.</p>

<p>"You can come, too, if you like, Mrs. Watson,"
said Mr. Martyn.</p>

<p>"Me, sir! Do you mean it?"</p>

<p>"Why of course. You don't think we give
invitations to married men without including their
wives?"</p>

<p>"That's a new idea," said Richard, "but I don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
know but what it's a good one. We shouldn't get
into half so much trouble as we do if our wives went
about with us more. I'm glad to have you, Jane; it's
a long spell since you and me went anywhere
together."</p>

<p>Satisfied with the success of his errand, Mr. Martyn
led the way, chatting to his companions, until they
entered the hall. There were many working-men
already there, some lounging in chairs, or on forms,
with their papers or books; others deeply interested
in the game of chess, or draughts. A few were
smoking, with glasses of refreshing, but certainly not
intoxicating, beverage before them. Richard was
wonderstruck at the novel scene, and its air of
thorough homeliness.</p>

<p>"This'll be the place for me, Jane," he whispered.</p>

<p>An address had been announced for that evening,
and Mr. Martyn was expected to speak. After
leading Richard and his wife to seats, he mounted the
platform at the end of the room, and in a friendly,
familiar style, commenced to talk with the company.
Most of them laid aside their occupations, well
pleased to listen to one who was known to be the
friend of working-men, and ever ready to help
them in the difficulties and temptations of their daily
life. Like dew on thirsty ground fell his wise
suggestions, his timely warnings, his earnest counsels,
upon the ears and hearts of the new-comers.</p>

<p>Responding to the invitation with which he closed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
they, with two or three others, stepped forward and
asked to sign the pledge, tremblingly venturing to
hope that even for them the future might hold a new
life.</p>

<p>We may take the liberty of raising the curtain
which conceals it from their view, and assuring our
readers that their hopes were realised, for the old
brightness and love found its way back into the home
in which sin and misery had reigned for years.
Trusting no longer in their own strength to keep the
good resolutions with which they commenced the new
life, they found that He, whom they had slighted and
forgotten, was not only ready to forgive their past sin
and folly, but was mighty to save and keep them to
the end of life's journey.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'><br />AY the Holy Vargin an' all the blissid
saints purtect us! Here's yer father
comin' up the coort as dhrunk as a pig.
Get along inter hidin' wid yer, childer!"
So saying, Mrs. Ryan, who had been standing with
her baby in the doorway of her wretched home,
gossiping with the neighbours, stepped into her
kitchen, and awaited the arrival of her drunken
husband with trepidation. "Maybe he'll tumble
upsthairs an' slape off his dhrops, bad cess to him
for a nasthy silfish brute," she muttered.</div>

<p>But no, Donovan Ryan staggered into the kitchen,
and greeted his wife with an inane smile, which in no
wise deceived her, taught by many an experience,
how more than likely it was that the next moment
his tipsy amiability might be exchanged for the
utmost fury.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>"An' what will I be gettin' for yer tay? Shure
ye're home airly the night," she tremblingly said.</p>

<p>"It's yersilf that's mighty oblagin' intoirely, an'
hasn't Donovan Ryan, at yer service, ma'am,"&mdash;making
a low bow which nearly lost him his unsteady balance,&mdash;"a
right to kem to his own home whiniver it may
plaze him, widout askin' yer lave, ye miserable, dirthy,
scoldin' broth uv a wumman?"</p>

<p>Donovan had raised his voice from low, mocking
accents to stentorian tones, which shook the little
room.</p>

<p>Poor Mrs. Ryan shrank further and further away.</p>

<p>"Shure, Donovan, I meant no harm at all, at all.
Be aisy now; an' I'll git ye a cup uv tay in a jiffy,"
she said, coaxingly.</p>

<p>But, according to his ideas, Donovan had received
a grievous insult, and there was only one way in
which the said insult could be avenged; and, being
made of that stern, courageous stuff of which some few
of our British workmen are composed, he proceeded
to teach Mrs. Ryan, in a very practical manner, that
she really must not venture to offend the perfectly
justifiable ideas which he held of his own importance
and dignity. In all wifely submission, as in duty
bound, and according to long-established custom, she
made no demur to the very ordinary proceeding which
occupied Donovan's attention for the next few minutes.</p>

<p>"See what ye'll git for venturin' to interfare wid
yer husban'," he said, as he paused for want of breath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>With a well-directed kick at the prostrate form
before him, and a few genial imprecations on womankind
in general and his own wife in particular, he
shuffled out of the house.</p>

<p>"He's been up to his tricks again; a beatin' of his
poor wife. It's well he ain't my husband. I'd never
stand it as she does, poor creature," said one of the
women who were standing about.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you'd prevent it; but I'm going
in to see whether poor Mrs. Ryan is quite done for."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fisher, the last speaker, left the group and
entered her neighbour's house. In response to a
feeble "Come in," she opened the kitchen door, which
Donovan had slammed behind him. Mrs. Ryan was
sitting on the floor crying bitterly.</p>

<p>"I'm kilt intoirely, Mrs. Fisher, an' me poor babby's
frighted to death. Shure her father's a murtherin',
battherin' wretch. I'll take him afore the magisthrate,
I will."</p>

<p>"Poor thing, let me see what I can do for you,"
said Mrs. Fisher.</p>

<p>A few womanly ministrations, a cup of tea and
kindly words, and Mrs. Ryan was comforted.</p>

<p>"Don't be thinkin' hardly uv Donovan. He's civil
spoken an' kind enough whin the dhrink's out uv him;
an' I'll have to put up wid his cross worruds an' his
batin's, for he's me husban' an' the father uv me
childer," were her parting words to her neighbour.</p>

<p>It was easy to be seen that Mrs. Ryan had proved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
no dull scholar, but had readily learned the manly
logic that might is right almost as perfectly as her
husband had intended that she should.</p>

<p>"I'll keep your children to tea, Mrs. Ryan; and,
if you like, they can go with my Jimmie and Alice
to some children's affair they're holding in the school-room
round the corner this evening."</p>

<p>"Shure ye're the bist uv neighbours an' I'm grateful
to ye for riddin' me uv the worrit uv of the childer
for a spell. But will ye jist sind Meg in afore she's
off to the matin'? Me head's crazy, an' she must git
me a dhrop uv the craythur to put a bit uv spirit
inter me."</p>

<p>Mrs. Fisher promised, and then left the house.</p>

<p>After tea, little Meg, a forlorn, wiry child of eight
years, came in and fetched the stimulant which her
mother craved, and with which Mrs. Ryan comforted
herself over her trying lot.</p>

<p>About eight o'clock the little ones returned. Three
unkempt, ragged urchins, full of excitement about
all they had witnessed.</p>

<p>"Oh, mother, sich pritty picthures, an' sich fine
singin'. An' sich nice spoken jintlemen an' ladies."</p>

<p>"An' sich swate cards wid ribbon to hang 'em up."</p>

<p>"An' what was it all about, thin?" asked the weary
mother, roused to interest.</p>

<p>Meg answered: "The jintlemen tould us that the
dhrink was a curse an' a shame, an' he said it made
folks cruel an' bad&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thrue for him!" interjected the mother.</p>

<p>"An' he said," continued Meg, "that it wad be
betther for no wan niver to touch it at all, at all, an'
thin they wad niver git dhrunk. An' he wanted all
the childer in the room to sign a promise niver to put
it to their lips; an' heaps uv 'em wint up an' signed,
an' got a card wid their names on to hang up, an'
Mrs. Fisher's Jimmie an' Alice signed. An' we said
we'd ax you, mammy, an' maybe you'd say, 'Yes,' an'
thin we could sign nixt week."</p>

<p>"Yes, an', mammy, we don't want to be like daddy
whin we grow up, so we may sign, mayn't we?"
eagerly put in Teddie, the youngest.</p>

<p>"Ye might be worse nor yer poor father, an' don't
ye say a worrud against him; an' as for ye signin'
the pledge, ye'll do no sich thing. A dhrap uv the
craythur now an' thin won't hurt a livin' soul; an'
I'll not have ye sit yersilves up to be betther nor yer
own father an' mother." And poor deluded Mrs. Ryan
finished her third glass of hot whiskey and water,
and drained the sweet dregs into the open mouth
of her wan-faced baby.</p>

<p>A few days after, his drinking bout being over for
the time being, Donovan Ryan sat over the kitchen
fire watching his wife's preparations for tea.</p>

<p>"Shure, Patty, have ye heard that Harry Fisher
has turned teetotal?" he suddenly said.</p>

<p>"Niver, shurely, now; what's the likes uv him, as
niver gits dhrunk more nor wance in a blue moon,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
nade to be jhinin' a wake-minded, wathery set like
the teetotalers?" exclaimed Mrs. Ryan, in a tone of
irritation.</p>

<p>Donovan stirred uneasily.</p>

<p>"Sorra am I the man to say he's made a misthake,
for I'd jhine that same set mesilf if I thought I'd
howld out whin the dhrink craze takes me."</p>

<p>"I'd be ashamed to own ye for me husban' if ye
made such a fool uv yersilf, Donovan," cried his wife,
with energy. "It's thrue enough ye overstips the
bounds uv sobriety oftener nor Harry Fisher, more
shame to ye; but to make out ye're afeard uv a dhrap
uv the craythur, an' give yer worrud niver to touch it,
wad be to confess yersilf a poor wake gossoon widout
any sperrit in him at all, at all."</p>

<p>Mrs. Ryan was never afraid of her husband in his
sober moments, as will be readily observed. Indeed,
at such times, he stood somewhat in awe of her sharp
tongue. On the present occasion she continued to
rail against water-drinkers and their weakmindedness,
till, as if ashamed of the moral cowardice he had
evinced, Donovan said:</p>

<p>"Whist, wumman, hould yer tongue, ye've no nade
to fear I'll jhine the teetotalers, so make yer mind
aisy on that point."</p>

<p>After which assurance Mrs. Ryan cooled down, and
allowed her husband to smoke his pipe in thoughtful
silence.</p>

<p>"What on airth are ye thinkin' uv, Mrs. Fisher, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
let yer husban' sign against a dhrap uv good beer?"
she said the next morning to her neighbour.</p>

<p>"I'm downright glad he has, and I mean to do the
same. You see, the children's set the example, and
were so earnest for their father to sign, that he made
up his mind to do so. I wish you'd let your little
ones do the same, and persuade your husband too."</p>

<p>"Bad cess to ye for settin' yerself up to be suparior
to yer neighbours, and advasin' uv them to follow yer
example. Faix, I'd rather me husban' git dhrunk
ivery blissid day uv his life, an' bate me black and
blue inter the bargain, nor sign the pledge." And in
high dudgeon Mrs. Ryan went in, slamming her door
behind her with great violence.</p>

<p>Weeks and months passed away, and still, in the
dingy court where the Ryans and Fishers lived, the
same sad scenes of sin and degradation were witnessed.
One day it was rumoured that the Fishers were moving
into a better neighbourhood, which rumour proved
to be correct.</p>

<p>"An' didn't I say as her ladyship, wid her illigant
slips uv childer, an' her jintleman husban' wad soon be
too suparior intoirely to mix wid the likes uv us. Axin'
yer kind lave, shure it's Peggy Ryan as wishes ye
ivery blissin', an' has the honour uv givin' ye a partin'
bit uv advace. Lave yer dacint neighbours alone, an'
don't hould yer head up so high, me dear." Thus
saying, Mrs. Ryan stood in front of Mrs. Fisher, who
was about to follow her goods and chattels out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
court, and, to the amusement of the bystanders, spread
out her scanty skirts, and made a sweeping curtesy.
For some time past Mrs. Fisher had found it
difficult to live peaceably among her neighbours,
proving how advantageous to health and pocket
her own and her husband's Temperance principles
had been, they had both tried to secure adherents to
the good cause. They had met with little success,
and in some instances, notably that of Mrs. Ryan, had
earned for themselves continual abuse and scorn.</p>

<p>Years passed and Donovan Ryan went down to a
drunkard's grave unwept and unhonoured. With
rapid footsteps his wife followed him, leaving to the
children as her legacy, the craving for intoxicants
which had been engendered in their infancy and
ministered to with such assiduity in following years.</p>

<p>Is the story improbable, impossible? No, for
thousands of lives cursed with the disease of drink
attest its truth.</p>

<p>There was a ray of hope seen; there was help
offered in earlier years; but some hand, perhaps that
of the wife and mother, quenched the hope, and
thrust aside the offered help, and forced those for
whose salvation it was responsible into paths of
ever-deepening darkness and rayless despair.</p>

<h2>HOW JARVIS WAS SAVED.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 81px;">
<img src="images/i-quote.png" width="81" height="83" alt="&quot;I" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />T'S quite true, ma'am, I've been a drinker;
but, indeed, I've given it up, and if you'll
only give me a chance of redeeming my
character, you shan't ever regret it."</div>

<p>The lady who was thus addressed looked up from
the letter she had been reading, somewhat doubtfully,
at the speaker who was a woman past her early youth,
red-faced and coarse-featured, but with honest gray
eyes and a set mouth that bore witness to the purpose
indicated by her words.</p>

<p>"But you lost your last situation by giving
way to drink," said Mrs. Reston.</p>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, I did. I had got into the habit, and
nothing was kept locked up, and I couldn't help
taking it when the longing came on me."</p>

<p>The woman was singularly frank the lady thought,
and after further conversation, it was decided that
she should enter Mrs. Reston's service as cook.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will find no temptation to drink here," said
Mrs. Reston. "I keep all intoxicants under lock and
key, and the housemaid does not take anything of
the kind. So you see, if you really wish to reform
you have a good chance, and, indeed, if I did not
think you were sincere in your wish to turn over
a new leaf, I would not engage you."</p>

<p>The woman's voice broke a little as she thanked her
future mistress and left the house.</p>

<p>"Really, Edmund, I was so struck by her intense
desire to begin a new life, and as in every other
respect her character was unimpeachable, I thought
here was a fine opportunity of putting the golden
rule into practice," replied Mrs. Reston to her
husband's remonstrances upon the rashness of her
proceeding.</p>

<p>"What a woman you are! You know that such
an argument is unanswerable, and I must retreat
from the field vanquished," laughingly remonstrated
the husband, and the matter dropped.</p>

<p>"Now, Jarvis," said Mrs. Reston, when a few
mornings later she had given her orders to the new
cook, "I dare say you will miss your usual stimulant
for some time, and you are quite at liberty to make
yourself coffee or cocoa whenever you wish, and if
there is any other way in which you may be helped
to fight against your besetment let me know, for
I want you to look upon me as your friend."</p>

<p>Cook stammered something unintelligible, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
somewhat surprised at her agitation, Mrs. Reston left
the kitchen.</p>

<p>"If this don't beat everything! Nothing but
lectures and black looks have I ever had before, and
now to think of a real lady speaking so kind, and
saying she wanted to be my friend!" And, in her
excess of astonishment and emotion, Jarvis stood and
watched the milk for the pudding she was about to
make boil over, and then mechanically emptied what
remained into the coffee dregs which were yet
standing on the breakfast table. Weeks passed away
and Mr. Reston ceased to tease his wife about her
latest philanthropic effort, and Mrs. Reston forgot to
watch Jarvis with anxiety, and dismissed all misgivings
as to the prudence of the step she had taken.</p>

<p>"Breakfast not ready yet! how's this?" asked
Mr. Reston one morning, entering the dining-room at
the usual time, to find the housemaid just commencing
to lay the cloth, and his wife looking troubled.</p>

<p>"It can't be helped, dear. Symonds has been
single-handed this morning, for Jarvis is not down
yet," replied Mrs. Reston. Her husband raised his
eyebrows and coughed significantly as he sat down
and took up his newspaper.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with your paragon, my dear?"
he presently said.</p>

<p>"I haven't asked her yet," was the dry answer.
Mr. Reston thought he had better not pursue the
subject, and relapsed into silence. After he had left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
the house, Mrs. Reston examined the contents of the
cellaret, and came to the conclusion that Jarvis had
been helping herself in large quantities from the
stores of wine and spirits kept there.</p>

<p>She had been visiting with her husband the previous
evening, and the housemaid had also been out, thus
leaving every opportunity for Jarvis to indulge in the
stimulants she had stolen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reston also remembered that on returning
home she had found the key of the cellaret, which
she had missed, lying on the floor close to the side-board,
and the door locked as usual. Symonds had
come in to prayers alone, and said that cook had gone
to bed with a bad headache.</p>

<p>"Send Jarvis to me as soon as she comes down,"
she said to the housemaid, who answered her
summons.</p>

<p>"It's too disappointing," she soliloquised; "I felt so
positive that Jarvis would do well; I am sure there is
nothing I have left undone to help her in her attempts
to abstain." Kind, good Mrs. Reston, there is just
one thing you have left undone; but when you shortly
learn how you have failed to do all that was necessary
to effectually help your weak sister, will you have
sufficient courage and love to enable you to remedy
the past and help to save a soul from perishing in
its sin?</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door, and Jarvis entered
with swollen, downcast eyes and face redder than usual.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, Jarvis," said Mrs. Reston, after a moment's
silence.</p>

<p>"I've got nothing to say, ma'am; I can go as soon
as you like," sullenly replied the woman.</p>

<p>Mrs. Reston sighed. Was it any use to give Jarvis
another trial, or should she send her away at once?
She looked at the half-averted face and the nervous
hands that were busily folding and unfolding the
hem of her apron, and with a wave of pity surging
in her heart for the sinning, suffering creature before
her, said quickly and tenderly:</p>

<p>"But I don't want you to go, Jarvis. I want to
save you, if you will let me. Come, tell me what else
I can do for you."</p>

<p>Jarvis looked up, half doubting the evidence of her
senses.</p>

<p>"Ma'am," she gasped, between heavy, choking
sobs; "do you really mean to say that you care about
saving such an ungrateful wretch as me?"</p>

<p>"Why, Jarvis, of course I do. I will do <i>anything</i>
to help you."</p>

<p>"Would you, oh would you do anything, ma'am?"</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Reston repeated the assurance. Battling
with her emotion, Jarvis said: "I'm ashamed to ask
such a favour at your hands, ma'am, but I believe
there's only one thing under heaven that would be the
saving of me."</p>

<p>"What is that, Jarvis?"</p>

<p>There was a long pause, and then Jarvis blurted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
out: "I've never signed the pledge, ma'am; but if you'd
draw up some kind of a promise to keep from the
drink, and put your own name to it, and let me sign
after, it would be the saving of me."</p>

<p>"What a strange thing to ask, Jarvis! What good
would it do you to know that I, who am always
moderate in my use of stimulants, had given them
up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am, it would make me feel that somebody
in this wide world cared enough for me to give up
something for my sake. I've never had any one to
care for me since my mother died fifteen years ago.
I made up my mind that I would be independent of
every one and look after myself, and when I felt dull
I just took a glass, until I got into the habit of taking
too much. When I came here you were so kind to
me that I couldn't help feeling you were different to
my other mistresses who only seemed to care how
much they could get out of me, and I've been that
grateful, ma'am, I would have done anything for you;
but last night I got low, and the longing for drink
took me, and something whispered: 'There's your
mistress for all her kind words, she's none so
different as the rest of them, only she's got another
way with her. You're a good cook and suit her well
while you keep from the drink, and she thinks if she
speaks fair she'll manage you well enough.' And
then, ma'am, I thought of your beautiful wines which
you could take without any harm to yourself, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
my beer had done such cruel work for me, and
suddenly the thought came: 'Why, your mistress
cares for those luxuries that she takes every day far
more than she does for you, you poor thing; she
wouldn't give them up to save you from filling a
drunkard's grave.' Then I grew desperate, and came
in here to see if there was anything left about, and
the key for once was in the side-board, and, and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, I know, my poor Jarvis, and now let me tell
you that I do care more for you a thousand times
than for the luxuries you speak of, and to prove it,
I will never touch them again. I promise that, for
your sake, Jarvis, do you understand?" For Jarvis
was standing looking stupified. Her wide-open eyes
suddenly filled with tears, and she fell at her mistress'
feet, and seizing her hand covered it with kisses.</p>

<p>"Oh, ma'am, you've saved me, you've saved me,"
she said again and again.</p>

<p>Yes, Jarvis was saved. From that time she steadily
fought against her deadly sin, until its besetment lost
all power over her.</p>

<p>After years of devoted service she became the
happy wife of one who loved and trusted her, and to
whom she confided the story of her past degradation,
and how she was reclaimed by the efforts and self-sacrifice
of her former mistress.</p>

<h2>WHY THE ANGELS REJOICED.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 83px;">
<img src="images/g-quote.png" width="83" height="82" alt="&quot;G" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'><br />OOD-NIGHT, Mrs. Seymour. Must you
leave so quickly?" asked a lady of an
elderly woman, who was hurrying past
her pew with the stream of worshippers
that were leaving the chapel after the Sabbath-evening
service was ended, without waiting for the short
prayer-meeting which usually followed.</div>

<p>"Yes, ma'am, I can't wait a minute longer, for my
husband's promised to go to the Mission Hall, and
the angels are going to rejoice to-night," answered
Margaret Seymour with a radiant light of expectancy
upon her pale face.</p>

<p>"God grant that you may not be disappointed,"
returned the lady, with a cordial pressure of the hand,
and, as Margaret hastened out, her friend inwardly
marvelled at the strong faith which, during a lifetime<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
of neglect and cruelty, had sustained her poorer
sister through terrible seasons of hardship and toil.</p>

<p>Margaret Seymour had early left a Christian home
to become the wife of a man, who, destitute of any
real religion himself, soon commenced to mock and
persecute the woman who had been induced to take a
false step, hoping to win her husband to seek for
himself the joys which were hers. But, hitherto, the
hope had proved vain. Richard Seymour had sunk
lower and lower, until, enfeebled in health by his
drunkenness and follies, his family mainly depended
upon the exertions of the wife and mother for daily
bread. Still, Margaret's faith did not fail. If she
worked incessantly all day long, and often far into
the night, her prayers went up without intermission
to the Throne of Grace. There had been a time
when she had trusted the answer was at hand, for her
husband had been induced to attend a small Mission
Hall near by, and whilst there had been powerfully
moved, and for a few weeks had given up some of his
sinful pursuits; but just when Margaret and the
friends from the Hall were beginning to rejoice over
Richard as a "brand plucked from the burning,"
he fell back into his former habits.</p>

<p>Margaret was sorely disappointed; but, casting
herself again upon the faithful word of her God, she
took up the cross apportioned to her, and went on
her way in confident assurance of coming blessing.
But for some weeks past her desire for her husband's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
salvation had intensified, and she had felt moved to
pray with an earnestness that surprised even herself.
Her cry became that of the patriarch: "I will not let
Thee go, except Thou bless me." But no apparent
result manifested itself. Indeed, Richard appeared
to grow more hardened and desperate than ever, and
it required all the grace and patience that Margaret
possessed, to endure his continual cruelty with
meekness.</p>

<p>On the Saturday evening preceding the Sunday
when she had expressed her conviction of a joyful
termination to her anxious watching, a knock was
heard at her door, and opening it, the kindly face of
one of the workers from the Mission Hall was seen.</p>

<p>"Is your husband in, Mrs. Seymour?" asked the
man.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Margaret, in an undertone, "he's
just sitting down a bit before going out for the
evening; but come in and you'll catch him nicely."</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Mr. Seymour, I'm glad to find you
at home," were the words that caused Richard to look
up in angry surprise.</p>

<p>"Evenin'," he muttered by way of reply, without
removing his pipe from his mouth.</p>

<p>"I'm real sorry to have missed you from the Hall
for so long, Mr. Seymour, and I've been wondering
whether you meant to leave us altogether. We only
want to be your friends, you know, and you don't
want to run away from those who would do you a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
good turn if you'd let them," said the worker, nothing
daunted by his ungracious reception.</p>

<p>Again Richard looked up, and perhaps the fact
that his visitor was a working-man not much above
his own station in life, rendered him more susceptible
to the attention shown him. And besides, the spoken
words were not mere empty talk, Richard could not
but acknowledge; for practical help in dire need had
found its way to the poverty-stricken home, from the
Christian friends who had rallied round his wife. So,
with half-shamed face, he answered gruffly:</p>

<p>"I didn't think of comin' again; such places ain't
for the likes of me."</p>

<p>"And who do you think they are for then? Why,
my man, it's poor folks like you and me, who wouldn't
feel comfortable in grand churches and chapels, that
want such homely places, where we can slip in and
out without being looked down upon."</p>

<p>"Maybe you're right so fur; but you don't want no
smokin', drinkin' fellers, anyhow," responded Richard.</p>

<p>"You're making another mistake, Mr. Seymour;
for the truth is, we're better pleased to see them turn
up than any other sort of folks; so you'd better give
me leave to call for you to-morrow evening at eight
o'clock, before the service begins."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm beat. You mean to take it out of me,
somehow, and I may as well give in, but you needn't
trouble to call. I'll come, sure enough."</p>

<p>"That's settled," said the man, rising to go, adding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
as he offered his hand to Richard, "You won't
forget."</p>

<p>"No fear, with my old woman to pester me,"
answered Richard, with a grim relaxing of his features.
But as the door closed behind the visitor, his face
darkened, and, although he said nothing to his wife,
he sat gloomily watching the fire for a long time,
then, muttering something about "them interferin'
folks," he put his pipe into his pocket, and passed
out into the street.</p>

<p>"God grant they may have interfered to some
purpose!" said Margaret.</p>

<p>Hastily finishing the domestic duties which were
filling her hands, she turned for encouragement to the
Book which had proved its power to solace and cheer
in the darkest hour. Presently, with thought and
desire too intense to allow the usual posture of
devotion, she rose, and began to pace her kitchen,
while she wrestled and interceded for her sinning
husband. It was during that memorable hour of
strong crying, that the sweet assurance of a speedy
answer was given; and the language of petition no
longer poured from her lips, but gave place to that of
thanksgiving for another repenting one, over whom
there would shortly be rejoicing "in the presence of
the angels."</p>

<p>But to the eye of sense, nothing seemed more
unlikely, as Richard staggered home late that night
in his usual drunken condition, and rose the next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
morning in the worst of tempers, following her footsteps
from place to place, with the evident purpose
of provoking her with his cruel taunts, until she
should retaliate. Clothed in the armour of God,
Margaret, however, withstood all the fiery darts that
were flung around her during that eventful day. As
the winter afternoon waned, she observed, with
uneasiness, that Richard made no attempt to change
the working clothes in which he had lounged about
all day, for the better suit and the clean shirt, which
she had managed by dint of self-denial should never
be wanting.</p>

<p>"I'm pretty sure he'll make that his excuse for not
going to the Hall to-night; but there, the Lord isn't
confined to that place, and He can just as well save
Richard in his dirty shirt at home, if He thinks best,
as up there; and He's going to do it, sure enough;
for didn't He tell me the angels should rejoice over
him?" she said to herself. She ventured, however,
a quiet remonstrance, saying: "Your Sunday
things are laid out, Richard, and you'd better get a
wash; you'll feel fresher." But the only answer she
received was a curt: "Mind your own business,
woman."</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Richard himself was feeling his own
misery more deeply than he would have confessed to
a living soul. "I'd like to escape from it all; but
I've gone too far; I've had my chances, if ever a man
had, and I'd like to know what good'll come of my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
goin' to the Hall and seein' all those folks again; it'll
only make me more miserable than I am. I wish
I hadn't promised, and I've half a mind to turn into
the 'Blue Boar' instead," muttered the man to himself.</p>

<p>"Richard," said his wife as she put on bonnet and
shawl, and picked up her Bible and hymn-book, after
tea was over; "I'm going up to the chapel, but the
sermon will be over in plenty of time for me to get
back to the Mission-place. You'll be sure to be
dressed and ready waiting for me."</p>

<p>"I shan't promise nothin'," growled Richard; but
although Margaret heard the words as she went out,
she left the house with a light heart. Altogether
uncertain of his own intention, Richard strode about
the room, his pipe in his mouth, and his hands in his
pockets.</p>

<p>"Anyhow," he said, "I may as well have a look at
the water," and going to the sink he washed himself
for the first time that day. And then he sat down,
making no further attempt to prepare himself for his
wife's return. "She never lets a feller have any peace,"
he said, inwardly blaming her for his mental unrest.
He was sitting in his chair, still smoking, when
Margaret returned.</p>

<p>"O, Richard, you are not ready, and we shall be
late!" she said.</p>

<p>"I never told you I was goin'," he answered,
scowling at her.</p>

<p>"No, but you told Mr. Brown so, last night; and if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
you aren't there soon, he's sure to come round, and
see what's the matter, as he would be certain to
suppose you'd keep your promise unless something
had happened."</p>

<p>Surely it was heaven-sent wisdom that breathed in
the words with which she answered Richard's evasions.
She was unprepared for the sudden effect of her
reply. Rising in haste, he said: "Here, get me my
things as quick as you can; I don't want that feller
again." In a few minutes, neatly dressed, Richard
went up the street with his rejoicing wife.</p>

<p>They were singing as the two entered; but
Margaret walked boldly up to the top of the room,
and Richard was reluctantly compelled to follow her.
He would have chosen to have slipped into the first
seat by the door, from whence egress could have been
easy; but his wife determined that once within those
four walls, Richard should stay until the end of the
meeting. So she allowed him to pass into his seat
first, and then she followed him. But there was little
fear of Richard being anxious to leave the place; for,
after the first prayer, he sat spell-bound, and riveted
to the spot, while the Holy Spirit revealed to him his
guilt and sin. His wasted life rose before him until
the burden of his misery seemed too great to be
borne, and he could no longer prevent groans and
tears from bearing witness to his anguish of soul.</p>

<p>"Come and speak to my poor husband, will you,
please, Mr. Brown?" said Margaret, as the people were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
dispersing. The man crossed the room, and sought
to pour in the balm of Gilead to the wounded
conscience.</p>

<p>"You don't think he died for such a big sinner as
me?" was the response. "Why, man, you don't know
what a life I've led my poor wife there! She's been
beaten and kicked, and half-starved most of her time,
while I've spent my money in what's ruined body and
soul, and you mean to tell me that I may be saved
from the hell I deserve?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I mean just that, and the Saviour tells you
so in His own words; so there can be no doubt
about it."</p>

<p>"Let me know quick what He says," groaned the
man. Mr. Brown took a pocket Bible from his coat
and read the following passages:</p>

<p>"Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and ye
shall be clean: from all your filthiness and from all
your idols, will I cleanse you." "The Son of man is
come to seek and to save that which was lost." "I am
not come to call the righteous, but sinners to
repentance." "Come unto Me, all ye that labour and
are heavy laden, and I will give you rest." "Him
that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out."</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say that's written all fair and
square, in black and white?" asked Richard, who had
been listening with open mouth to the slow reading
of the inspired words.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do; here, look for yourself." Richard<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
grasped the book and, following the direction of
Mr. Brown's finger, with difficulty spelled out for
himself the blessed promises and invitations. As he
reluctantly handed the Bible back, a sigh of relief
broke from him, and he exclaimed: "Ay, it's there,
sure enough! so He came to call sinners, did He?
drunkards like me!" A wonderful light overspread
his face, and as the truth broke fully upon his
troubled mind, he started to his feet crying out: "O,
what a mighty Saviour! Bless Him, bless Him, for
He died for me!" The workers gathered round in
silent joy as the shout of a King rang through the
place; but Margaret fell upon her knees and broke
into praise that was surely no faint echo of the
exulting song which pealed through the courts of
heaven as the glad tidings were proclaimed of
another soul new-born into the liberty of the sons of
God.</p>

<p>"Ah, my dear," said Richard to his wife, as late at
night they sat together in their home: "I've been a
brute to you and the children; but, God helping me,
I'll make amends."</p>

<p>"Don't trust to yourself, Richard, my dear; you'll
get plenty of chaff from your mates, and plenty of
temptation from within, and you must look for help
to Him who's got all needful strength and grace
for you," replied Margaret, as they sat and talked
with one another far on into the early morning.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p><hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>"I say, nurse, can't you give this 'ere feller a sleepin'
draught, or summat as will keep his mouth shut for a
spell? There's no such thing as gettin' a wink o'
sleep with him a shoutin' 'glory' all the time," said a
rough man who was occupying one of the beds in the
infirmary.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! it's a wonder to me how he can bear
so much suffering and never open his lips to
complain," answered the nurse, turning her kindly
eyes towards the adjoining bed, where lay Richard
Seymour, wasted by the ravages of a sore disease,
doubtless the result of early excess and long years of
intemperance. After witnessing a good confession of
his faith before ungodly companions, and for his
Master's sake enduring scorn and persecution nobly,
he had suddenly been laid low on the bed of death.</p>

<p>"You needn't make any wonder of it, nurse," he
answered; "I don't feel as if I could grumble at my
pain when my blessed Lord suffered on the cross for
me&mdash;praise His dear name!"</p>

<p>"Queer kind of a chap, ain't he?" said the man
who had first spoken, moving uneasily in his bed.</p>

<p>"Ay, Jim, I wish you knew what it was to feel
'queer' after the same fashion. You may if you like,
you know; the same mercy's for you as for me, and
O, mates!" said Richard, looking round upon the
rows of faces that were turned towards him; "it may
be 'queer;' but it's worth while havin' somethin'
that will make you so happy when you come to face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
death, that you can't sleep for thinkin' of the blessed
Saviour, and how He's waitin' for you."</p>

<p>So Richard testified to his fellow-sufferers until the
last. Early one morning the nurse heard him whisper
faintly: "I'll soon be at home over there." The next
moment he quietly closed his eyes in death. Verily,
a brand plucked from the burning, a sinner saved by
grace.</p>

Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
